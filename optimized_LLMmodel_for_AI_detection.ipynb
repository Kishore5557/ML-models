Today, I\\'m gonna talk about something super important that can help you achieve your dreams and live a happier life – having a positive attitude! You might be thinking, \"But how can a simple attitude change everything?\" Well, let me tell you, it can! I\\'m gonna share some cool facts and examples on how having a positive outlook can lead to success in all areas of life. So, grab a snack, get comfy, and let\\'s dive in!\\n\\nResearch:\\nI did some research on successful people who ooze positivity, and wow, their stories are inspiring! Take Oprah Winfrey, for instance. She grew up in poverty and faced tons of challenges, but she never lost faith. She believed in herself and her abilities, and now she\\'s one of the most influential women in the world! Another example is Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Group. He\\'s always been optimistic, even when things went wrong. He says, \"If you want to be a good 1st-down player, start by aiming for the 2nd down!\" That\\'s the power of positivity!\\n\\nCharacteristics of a Positive Person:\\nSo, what makes someone with a positive attitude tick? Here are some traits they usually have:\\n\\n1. Gratitude: They\\'re always thankful for what they have and express it.\\n2. Optimism: They believe good things will happen, even when things are tough.\\n3. Resilience: They can bounce back from failures and setbacks like a pro.\\n4. Positive Self-Talk: They encourage themselves with kind words and focus on their strengths.\\n\\nExamples of Positivity in Action:\\nNow, let\\'s see how having a positive attitude can lead to success in different areas of life:\\n\\n1. Work: When you\\'re positive, you\\'re more productive, creative, and better at solving problems. Think about it – wouldn\\'t you rather work with someone who\\'s energetic and enthusiastic than someone who\\'s always grumbling?',\n",
       " 'As an eighth-grade student, I have always been passionate about learning and personal growth. Growing up, I was fortunate to have parents who instilled in me the values of responsibility, hard-work, reliability, and teamwork. These qualities have been instrumental in shaping me into the best candidate for any job opportunity that comes my way.\\n\\nOne of the most important lessons I learned from my upbringing was the value of responsibility. From a young age, my parents taught me to take responsibility for my actions and to always be accountable for my mistakes. They emphasized the importance of being honest and reliable, and they always encouraged me to take ownership of my work. This lesson has been invaluable in my personal and professional life, as it has taught me to always be accountable for my actions and to take ownership of my work.\\n\\nAnother important quality that has been instilled in me is hard-work. My parents have always taught me that success comes from hard work and dedication. They have encouraged me to never give up, even when things get tough. This has taught me to always put in the extra effort and to never settle for mediocrity. I believe that these qualities will make me an excellent candidate for any job opportunity, as I am always willing to put in the extra effort to achieve my goals.\\n\\nIn addition to responsibility and hard-work, I have also learned the importance of teamwork. Growing up, I was involved in various extracurricular activities, such as sports and music. These activities taught me the importance of working well with others and communicating effectively. I learned to listen to others, compromise, and work together to achieve a common goal. These skills have been invaluable in my personal and professional life, as they have taught me to always work well with others and to communicate effectively.\\n\\nOne story that stands out to me is when I was a part of a school project with my classmates. We were tasked with creating a presentation on a specific topic. However, one of my classmates was struggling with their part of the presentation, and they were unable to contribute effectively. Instead of getting frustrated or upset, I decided to take the initiative and offer to help my classmate. I spent extra time with them, went over their material, and provided feedback and guidance. This experience taught me the importance of being a good team player and always being',\n",
       " \" Someone who has shared wisdom and experience with me is my friend, Generic_Name. He has been battling stage 2 cancer his entire life, but he remains optimistic and focused on enjoying his time. He is an inspiration to me and a true friend, always making others around him happy with his sense of humor and positive attitude.\\n\\nAnother person who has shared their wisdom and experience with me is my grandma. She has taught me so much about cooking, from basic dishes to more complex recipes. Her energy and passion for cooking are contagious, and I have learned so much from watching her in the kitchen.\\n\\nOne of the most valuable lessons I have learned from my grandma is how to use spices and cuts of meat in a dish. She has been cooking for almost her entire life and knows what flavors work well together. Her knowledge of cooking has taught me how to make delicious and healthy meals that I enjoy.\\n\\nWhen it comes to learning from the experiences of others, I believe that it is essential. Those who have lived longer and have more experience in a particular area are often the best teachers. They have studied and practiced their craft, and they have gained a deep understanding of what works and what doesn't.\\n\\nFor example, when it comes to spending money, my grandparents have taught me the importance of saving for the future. They have advised me to invest in things that will last and to avoid making impulsive purchases. By listening to their advice, I have been able to make better financial decisions and build a more secure future.\\n\\nOverall, I believe that learning from the experiences of others is one of the most valuable things we can do. Whether it's cooking, driving, or teaching, there is always something new to learn from those who have been there before. By seeking out the wisdom and experience of others, we can become more knowledgeable and confident in our own lives.\",\n",
       " 'Libraries have been around for centurys and they have played a vital role in the spread of knowldge and information. But with the advenment of technology and the internet, some peoples are wondering if libries are still nessecary. In my opinion, libries are just as important now as they have ever been.\\n\\nFirstly, libries provide a quite and peacefull enviroment for peoples to learn and study. Unlike the internet, which can be filled with distractions and false information, libries offer a place where peoples can focus and concentrate on their work. Also, libries have trained librarians who can help peoples find the information they need, unlike the internet where it can be hard to seperate fact from fiction.\\n\\nSecondly, libries offer a wide range of resources that cant be found on the internet. For example, many libries have rare and old books that cant be found online. These books can be important for research and for understanding the past. Also, libries often have special collections and archives that are unique to their community, such as local history or genealogy resources.\\n\\nThirdly, libries play an important role in promoting literacy and a love of reading. They offer a wide range of books, magazines, and other materials that can interest peoples of all ages. This can help to encourage a love of reading and learning, which is important for success in school and in life.\\n\\nFinally, libries are a important part of the community. They offer a place for peoples to come together and share ideas, and they often host events and programs that are beneficial to the community. For example, many libries offer free computer and internet access, which can be important for peoples who dont have these things at home.\\n\\nIn conclusion, libries are still an important part of our community and our society. They offer a unique and valuable service that cant be replicated by the internet. They provide a place for learning, research, and community building, and they are still nessecary in the digital age.',\n",
       " ' Learning something new can be challenging, but it is essential for growth and development. One of the most important aspects of learning is the willingness to step outside of your comfort zone and try something beyond what you have already mastered. This is a concept that Ralph Waldo Emerson emphasized in his quote, \"unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.\" I agree with this quote because of my personal experiences with learning a new language and playing video games.\\n\\nWhen I first came to school, I did not speak any English. I felt isolated and struggled to understand what the teacher was saying. It wasn\\'t until my mother, who had limited English, helped me practice and perfect my language skills that I was able to fluently speak both languages. This experience taught me that with effort and dedication, I could overcome any obstacle and achieve my goals.\\n\\nSimilarly, when I received an Xbox One for Christmas, I was excited to start playing video games. However, I quickly realized that I did not know how to use the console and it took me two weeks to fully understand its operation. After that, I started playing Fifa 18 and Fortnite, but I found the games difficult and became addicted. I started to neglect my schoolwork and my grades began to fall. My father warned me that if I did not improve my grades, he would have to take away the console.\\n\\nThis experience taught me the importance of balancing my time and prioritizing my education. I realized that while gaming can be fun, it is not worth sacrificing my grades and my future opportunities. I started to focus on my schoolwork and my grades improved.\\n\\nWhile some may disagree with Ralph Waldo Emerson\\'s quote, I believe it is a valuable reminder to always strive for growth and development. Whether it is learning a new language, playing video games, or pursuing a new career, stepping outside of your comfort zone and trying something new can lead to personal and professional success.',\n",
       " ' The summer break is a time for relaxation and rejuvenation, but some people argue that it is too short. They believe that the summer break should be extended and the spring break should be taken away to provide more time for standardized testing.\\n\\nIn my opinion, the summer break is an important time for students to unwind and spend time with friends and family. However, it is also a time for students to catch up on any work they may have fallen behind on during the school year. By extending the summer break, students would have more time to focus on their studies and prepare for the upcoming school year.\\n\\nFurthermore, by taking away the spring break, students would have more time to participate in extracurricular activities and engage in community service. This would provide them with valuable experiences and opportunities to develop new skills.\\n\\nIn addition, by starting the summer break in June and ending in August, students would have more time to enjoy the warm weather and engage in outdoor activities. This would provide them with a much-needed break from the cold weather of May.\\n\\nOverall, while some people may argue that the summer break is too short, I believe that it is an important time for students to relax and rejuvenate. However, by extending the summer break and taking away the spring break, students would have more time to focus on their studies and engage in valuable experiences.',\n",
       " 'The central idea of this article is \"That studying venus i s a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.\" I do not agree that the article supports this idea. The author talks about all the geological/environmental challenges it presents, talks about how we haven\\'t set a space craft there in three decades that wasn\\'t even manned and only lasted a few hours, and how the planet isn\\'t liveable.\\n\\nThe first reason I don\\'t think the author supports the idea is because more than half of the essay is them talking about how Venus is awful when it comes to the actual form and environment of Venus. The environment of Venus was spoken about throughout the essay stating \"97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acis in Venus\\'s atmosphere.\" This is creates huge challenge for scientists to explore Venus. The plsnet is also too hot like 10x way too hot. It states in the article, \"On the planet\\'s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" The author talks about how the environment is SO extreme that it would crush submarines and liquefy many metals.\\n\\nThe second reason I don\\'t think the author supports the idea is they talk about how they haven\\'t sent anything there in three decades. They can\\'t send anything there because of how bad the conditions are on Venus and nothing has ever survived. It states in the article, \"Humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each...mission was unmanned....since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.\" The reason they haven\\'t anything is because we don\\'t have the ability to. The conditions there are too extreme for even our technology to withstand and like what I am going to discuss in the next paragraph it would take decades to develop that technology.\\n\\nThe last reasons I don\\'t think the author supports the idea, that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because the planet is not even liveable. Throughout the article the author constantly talks about how extreme the environment is, how it could basically kill any humans with it\\'s gas and heat, and we would still need decades od innovations to even think about even sending something there. If we even developed that technology we would have to prove it to be safe as well. It took us years to even send people to the moon and people STILL die while in space just for common reasons.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we may be the twin to Venus but it will take us years and years and years to even get close to sending man or even things to Venus because of the enviromental issues. Venus is unliveable and most things would never survive there for long periods of time. We also have no put any time and effort to really discover Venus and other things to help get us to explore Venus. For these reasons that I have stated above, I conclude that the author does not support the idea that \"That studying venus i s a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.\" ',\n",
       " \"Research shows that recognizing a student's efforts can have a positive impact on their self-esteem and self-confidence. Studies have revealed that teacher recognition can motivate students to challenge themselves and work hard to reach their goals. Some people believe that teachers should only give recognition for work that meets or exceeds expectations, while others argue that recognition should still be given for effort, even when the results achieved are not up to expected standards. For example, a teacher might recognize a student with a 'try again' sticker, to show the student's effort was appreciated even though their work wasn't quite successful. Ultimately, it is up to the teacher to decide when and based on what criteria recognition should be given, although studies have found that recognition of any kind is beneficial.\",\n",
       " 'Dear Mr. Senator,\\n\\nI am fed up with the electoral college. The system allows for so much disaster to occur. It isn\\'t strict at all and it allows a varity of things to happen that wouldn\\'t end well. The people deserve to make the decisions. Because the electoral college systems has so many holes and problems with it.\\n\\nOne of the best arguments against the electoral college is what we call the disaster factor. One big example of the disaster factor is the 2000 year election. In this election Al Gore had more votes than George Bush, but still lost by 5 votes because of the electoral college. In 1960, segregationists in Louisiana almost succeeded in replacing the democratic electors who oppose John F. Kennedy. If they succeeded and the popular vote went to Kennedy, it would not have actually gone to Kennedy. (\"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong\" Plumer)\\n\\nSecond off, one of the most worrying things is if there is a tie in the electoral vote. If that happens the election vote would be given to the House of Representatives, where the state delegations vote for the president. The vice president vote is given to the senate. Each state only casts one vote which insures that 55 million voters and 500,000 have the same power. Given the size of those numbers, and that people in those states may vote one party for president and one party for congress, the House\\'s decision could hardly reflect on the peoples choice. We have come pretty close to this happening too, in 1976 a tie would have occurred if 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted differently. (\"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong\" Plumer)\\n\\nThere is a few reasons that opposing opioninated people use to justify wanting to keep the Electoral College around. One of them is that the president has to appeal to multiple regions. A candidate can not just be a favor of the south and get elected, he has to campaign and be desirable to all the regions. This is good because a president that was popular in just one region would not be successful, because everyone else in the other regions would feel like they do not regard their interests. Unfortuanitly this is solved by popular vote, since it is by individual not by state. Other votes in other states balance them out. (\"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president\" Poser)\\n\\nThe Electoral College has many reasons for it and against it. But I strongly feel that we should get rid of it for the reasons shown above. From the \"Disaster factor\" to the threat of a electoral tie. Of course other people feel differerent and have different opinions but I feel like popular vote is for the best. Thank your for taking the time to listen to my opinions.\\n\\nThank you,\\n\\nPROPER_NAME   ',\n",
       " 'Hey there!  For this essay, I wanted to explore how having a positive attitude can lead to success in life. I mean, let\\'s be real, having a positive outlook can make such a big difference in how we approach challenges and how others perceive us.\\n\\nFirst of all, when you have a positive attitude, you\\'re more likely to take risks and try new things. Like, think about it, if you\\'re always thinking \"this might not work out\" or \"I\\'m not good enough,\" you\\'re gonna miss out on some amazing opportunities. But if you\\'re like, \"YOLO, let\\'s give it a shot!\" you\\'re way more likely to succeed. Plus, it\\'s way more fun to try new things when you\\'re excited about it!\\n\\nAnd it\\'s not just about taking risks, having a positive attitude can also help you make better connections with people. When you\\'re positive and enthusiastic, people are way more likely to want to be around you and work with you. Like, think about it, would you rather work with someone who\\'s always complaining or someone who\\'s always excited about the project?  Exactly.\\n\\nBut, I know some people might say that having a positive attitude doesn\\'t really affect success in life. They might say that hard work and talent are way more important than being positive. And while that\\'s true, I think it\\'s way more important to have a good attitude while you\\'re working hard and being talented. I mean, if you\\'re putting in all this effort and you\\'re still not getting the results you want, it can be really discouraging. But if you\\'re positive and excited about what you\\'re doing, it\\'s way easier to keep going and keep trying.\\n\\nAnd let\\'s not forget about the benefits of being positive and successful at the same time. When you\\'re achieving your goals and you\\'re feeling good about it, it\\'s like this huge boost to your self-esteem. You\\'re like, \"Yessss, I did it!\" And it\\'s way more fun to celebrate your successes when you\\'re feeling good about yourself.\\n\\nBut, I guess some people might',\n",
       " 'Winston Churchill\\'s famous statement, \"success is marked by failure,\" is a powerful reminder that achieving one\\'s goals in life and solving problems is not always a smooth and easy process. In fact, it is often through our failures that we learn the most and ultimately find success. In this essay, I will analyze and discuss how Churchill\\'s statement relates to achieving one\\'s goals in life and solving problems.\\n\\nFirstly, Churchill\\'s statement highlights the importance of failure as a learning opportunity. Failure is often seen as a negative thing, something to be avoided at all costs. However, Churchill\\'s statement suggests that failure is not something to be feared, but rather something to be embraced. When we fail, we are presented with an opportunity to learn from our mistakes and improve ourselves. By learning from our failures, we can ultimately find success in the future.\\n\\nSecondly, Churchill\\'s statement emphasizes the idea that success is not always a straight line. Rather, it is often a winding path, full of twists and turns. This means that achieving our goals and solving problems is not always a simple or straightforward process. We may encounter obstacles and setbacks along the way, but it is through these challenges that we ultimately find success.\\n\\nFurthermore, Churchill\\'s statement suggests that success is not just about achieving our goals, but also about how we handle failure. It is not enough to simply succeed; we must also learn from our failures and use them to grow as individuals. This means that we must be resilient and persistent in the face of adversity. We must be able to bounce back from failure and continue to move forward towards our goals.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Winston Churchill\\'s statement that \"success is marked by failure\" is a powerful reminder that achieving one\\'s goals in life and solving problems is not always a smooth and easy process. Rather, it is often through our failures that we learn the most and ultimately find success. We must embrace failure as a learning opportunity, be resilient and persistent in the face of adversity, and use our failures to grow as individuals. By doing so, we can achieve our goals and find success in all areas of our lives.',\n",
       " 'First impressions can be highly influential, but they are not always indicative of the reality of a situation or person. People often bring their own biases and assumptions to a situation, influencing the way they perceive a person or event initially. Over time, with more interaction and experience, people can learn new things about a person or situation and their perception can change as a result. \\n\\nFor example, when someone meets a person for the first time, they may make an assumption about them based on their appearance or behavior. Over time, through conversation and shared experiences, that initial assessment may be modified as they learn more about the other person. Similarly, when someone first experiences an unfamiliar environment, they may form an opinion about the place. As they take the time to explore further, however, they might find new information that alters their initial impression.',\n",
       " 'I believe that this technology would be very useful for use in a classroom. This is so because this kind of technology could help determine how much, if any at all, help a student would need in dealing with their emotions. It would also help figure out what triggers certain reactions in certain students.\\n\\nThe first reason that this tech would work for students in a classroom is that it could help find out when a student is having a bad day and determine whether or not that student requires some form of psychiatric help. This kind of technology could help with depression, anxiety, and it could even stop the next school shooter, in an extreme case, yes, but possible nonethless.\\n\\nThe second reason this technology could be very useful is it could help the teachers understand what actions or words trigger what reactions in students. This is useful because it could be used to take a survey, collecting data and deciding what gives a bad reaction the most and least out of all the people being surveyed. This could be used to decide the curriculum, activities, etc.\\n\\nNow, I understand that there are a decent amount of cons alongside the positive side of this technology, but I believe that the pros far outweigh the negatives in this scenario.

       " 'Dear State Senator,\\n\\nThe Electoral College is widely awknowledged for serves a purpose as a method of selecting a president and vice president, not a legitimate college. The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers in the Constitution as a compromise between having the President elected by a vote in Congress and an election by a popular vote of qualified citizens. This process of choosing a president needs to be modified into popular vote for the reasons that the Electoral College was established to actually vote a slate of electors, voters feel disenfranchised, and is unfair to voters.\\n\\nTo begin with, the Electoral College was actually established for voters to vote for a series of electors, which then get together to have the final decision. Stated in \"What is the Electoral College?\" by the Office of the Federal Register, \" The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise...process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\" This means that under this system, voters don\\'t vote for the president, but for electors who then elect the president. The voters sometimes aren\\'t told full front that they are chosing someone else and not always can they control who their electors are voting, leaving many puzzled. Voters aren\\'t to be puzzled. They are to vote who they\\'d like because it allows them a freedom to express who they want because they are strongly awknowledged of the troubles of their society and how they should be handled.\\n\\nIn addition, the Electoral College makes voters feel discouraged and disenfranchised. According to \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\" by Richard A. Posner, it is stated, \" No region...has enough electoral votes to lect a president...residents of the other regions are likely to feel...that their votes do not count...that he really isn\\'t their president.\" This means that voters feel that the presidnet they chose is their president because they believe their votes count.\\n\\nFuthermore, the Electoral College is unfair and irrational to voters because the candidates they \"vote\" for don\\'t spend time with them. Sizes matter to the candidates. According to \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\" by Bradford Plumer, it is stated, \"...the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takes-all system in each state, candidates do\\'t spend time in states they know have no chance of winning...\" This quote conveys that because some states are small in population and size, they will not help the candidate succeed. This is immensely discouraging to the voters because they feel worthless for not being big in size. Candidates should not have an excuse to not thank all their voters because every vote counts, not matter how small.\\n\\nAdmittedly, the Electoral College allows a clear and certain outcome because it exceeds the popular vote, however, the method is actually turning off potential voters for a candidate. The popular vote allows every voter to express their opinions because the overall vote chooses the puopular president.\\n\\nIn the final analysis, a change is needed because with the Electoral College many candidates are losing potential voters considering that the qualified feel that they arn\\'t doing much by voting considering they aren\\'t voting for the president, but a gamut of electors to vote for them. They alos express the feeling of discontent and unfairness because they feel that they don\\'t count and know they have no chance at winning.       \\xa0    ',\n",
       " \"Sure, I'd be happy to write an essay on the benefits of taking an online class from home!\\n\\nResearching the Advantages of Online Classes\\n\\nTaking an online class from home has several advantages that make it an attractive option for many students. Firstly, online classes offer flexibility and convenience, allowing students to learn at their own pace and on their own schedule. This is especially helpful for students who have busy schedules or who live far away from a physical classroom. Additionally, online classes eliminate the need for students to commute to school, which can save time and money.\\n\\nAssessing the Amount of Focus and Concentration Needed\\n\\nHowever, taking an online class requires a certain amount of focus and concentration. Students must be able to stay on task and avoid distractions, such as social media or television, in order to be successful. This can be challenging, as students may find it difficult to stay motivated and engaged without the structure of a traditional classroom. To be successful in an online class, students must be able to manage their time effectively and stay organized.\\n\\nExploring the Benefits of Online Classes\\n\\nDespite the challenges, online classes provide many benefits for students. For one, they offer the opportunity to learn from anywhere in the world, allowing students to access high-quality education regardless of their location. Additionally, online classes can provide a more personalized learning experience, as students can work at their own pace and receive one-on-one support from teachers. This can be especially helpful for students who need extra support or who have learning difficulties.\\n\\nAnalyzing the Value of Free Time and Testing in Online Classes\\n\\nAnother benefit of online classes is the flexibility they offer in terms of testing. Students can take tests at their own convenience, which can be especially helpful for students who have busy schedules or who live far away from a physical classroom. Additionally, online classes provide students with more free time, as they do not have to spend time commuting to and from school. This free time can be used for other activities, such as extracurricular activities or work.\\n\\nCreating an Outline for the Essay\\n\\nI.

The activity would also show if they are good or bad at it, but they could always practice harder. Practicing something will cause the student to want to do better and show that they can do it better.\\n\\nIn conclusion, students should do at least one extracurricular activity. It'll help students to get more involved into school and the school spirit.

       " \"High school year is the most important year in students life. Some school programs allow students to graduate in three years,if you can choose, which one would you like to take? traditional or three years? For me, I would think of four years high school. Because traditional four years high school is more better than three years high school. For example, if you take three years high school, then you can not take elective courses except you take the courses during the summer time. Also, I think three years high school don't have much time to let you get ready for college. In addition, I think four years high school is more comfortable then three years high school.\\n\\nFirst of all,if you take the three years high school, then you can't take elective courses except if you take the courses during the summer time. I think have elective courses was important, because that mean you can take courses that you interesting of. For example, I was taking the traditional four years high school right now. A year before, I remember I have two elective class, and one of them was Korean. Even know learning different language is hard, but it was very interesting, because you are learning about another countries' culture and how did they treat people in their ways. That's why I think elective classes was important.\\n\\nsecondly, take the courses during the summer time? Of course not. In the summer everyone was plan go to the beach or traveling to another country with the family. Think about that sunshine, sky, golden sand, and beautiful seas. There are people swimming and surfing, people wear the sunglasses sat down there and have coconut on their hand. But at this time, you have to take courses at home or summer school. Sitting at chair, face all these hard problem and finished it. In addition, summer is the time that people relax and have fun of. So I would not taking the courses during the summer time.\\n\\nIn addition, lots of students are feeling nervous and scared in the last year of their high school time. Because they are wondering what college they going to and can they do well when they get in the college. Even know I was senior right now, but that still happens to me, because college is totally different than high school, and I worry a lot about it. So when I laying down on the bed at the night, I was start thinking about college, can I make friends in college or what if the class that I take is going too fast then I don't understand what teachers are talking about. So I think four years high school would have more time to get ready for college.\\n\\nEven know some programs are allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years, but think about that, if you and your friends didn't go to the same college, then you will have to leave them early and you also have to leave your family one year early.\\n\\nFinally, I think traditional four years high school is more better then three years high school, and it makes you feel comfortable and have more time, instead squeeze the time together and make your self busy then others. Lastly, these are the reasons why I think traditional four years high school is better then three years high school.\",\n",
       " \"Why online classes are an innovation!\\n\\nGeneric_Name 3/9/20\\n\\nOnline classes have been an option for students since the online revolution in the early 2000's. But, some speculate that online classes are a waste of time and money, while others feel that online classes are the answer to their prayers. Many students want to learn as much as they can, but sometimes their schedules are filled to the brim with classes. Other students just cannot attend classes at all! This is where online classes come in. Online classes are beneficial to students who cannot attend regular classes; who live far from the school; and who want to take more classes than their schedule allows.\\n\\nSome people have disabilities that do not allow them to go places very often. Nowadays, schools have become more friendly to disabled people. But people still feel uncomfortable when going to a school. Online school is a benefit for students who cannot attenda regular school. n Some people in wheelchairs, for example, hate going to school because thye feel uncomfortable around people who were taller than they were. The county that they lived in offered online classes, and they used those instead of going to a regular school. Most school districts offer online courses, and anyone has access to them. Even if someone just does not feel comfortable going places and interacting with others face-to-face, they have access to online schooling, and get the same education and even more classes than regular school students have.\\n\\nCollege is always appealing, mainly towards high school seniors who will be entering the work force after high school. But colleges offer different subjects, and not all of them have the same courses. Online colleges are beneficial to students who live far from school. Many people do college searches,and can not find any colleges in their state that had the course they were looking into. They did not want to be far from home, so they looked up some colleges out of state that offered the same course they wanted to take. They found an online course at an out-of-state college, and did not have to leave home to attend college! This does not just apply to colleges, out-of- county high schools, and even middle schools offer courses not available in one direct county. Online classes make it easy to take a course that is not within a students county or state.\\n\\nThere are other benefits to online schooling than just distance. When a student makes their schedule for the next school year, sometimes it fills up quick, and a student may wish to take a course that they cannot take in school. Online classes are a benefit to students who do not have more room in their schedule for extra classes. Some people who are interested in space exploration and astronomy, could not an advanced astronomy class beacuse their schedules were filled with other advanced math and science classes, along with their normal core classes. But they were able to take that astronomy course online, and they love it. Onine classes make it easier to take the classes you want, and not have to make up the classes that you need in the following years. Some counties even offer classes that the rest of their state does not offer!\\n\\nTaking an online class is benficial in a variety of ways. People with disabilities and who are uncomfortable in public now can go to school in the safe haven of their own homes! Students who live too far from the school that they would like tro attend can now register and take that schools online classes. Students can now also learn more advanced and uncommon subjects from home and still take their regular classes at school. People who are more comfortable at home, who want to take a class from a school far from them, and students who want to learn more can now use online classes to do just that! Now the student can use this awesome resource to their advantage!\",\n",
       " 'Working in a group has many benefits that can outweigh working alone. Firstly, collaboration is key when completing a task. Having different ideas from other members of the group provides an opportunity to explore and to create a well-rounded outcome. Furthermore, working in a group allows multiple perspectives and approaches to be discussed and weighed up. The range of knowledge and expertise found in a group can lead to better decision making and a higher quality of work.\\n\\nCommunication is also improved when working as a team. Open dialogue and discussion can ensure that everyone is kept informed, and that any misunderstandings are quickly identified. Working in a group also allows tasks to be completed at a faster pace, with people able to specialise in certain areas or to take on specific roles.\\n\\nFinally, working in a group facilitates understanding in ways that working alone does not. Members of the group can provide support and guidance, and help each other to grow in knowledge and skills. Working together can also create a sense of unity and solidarity that would not be possible in an individual setting.\\n\\nIn conclusion, working in a group can be hugely beneficial for many reasons, including collaboration, communication, faster work and improved understanding.',\n",
       " 'As high school students, we are often overwhelmed with the many decisions we have to make about our future. One of the most important decisions we have to make is what career we want to pursue. In this essay, I will explore the different career options available to high school students and their associated benefits. I will also discuss how career identification can help students enjoy learning and stay motivated to achieve their goals.\\n\\nThere are many different career paths available to high school students, and each one has its own unique benefits. Some students may choose to pursue a career in the arts, such as music, theater, or visual arts. These careers offer the opportunity to express creativity and passion for a particular field. Others may choose to pursue a career in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM). These careers offer the opportunity to use their analytical skills and problem-solving abilities to make a difference in the world.\\n\\nCareer identification can be a powerful tool in helping students enjoy learning and stay motivated to achieve their goals. When students have a clear idea of what they want to do, they are more likely to be engaged and interested in their studies. This can lead to better grades, increased participation in class, and a greater sense of purpose and direction. Additionally, when students have a career commitment, they are more likely to work hard and persevere through challenges.\\n\\nHaving a career commitment can also lead to a successful future. Studies have shown that students who have a clear career goal are more likely to graduate from college and find meaningful employment. This is because they have a clear direction and purpose, which helps them stay focused and motivated. Additionally, having a career commitment can lead to greater job satisfaction and a greater sense of fulfillment in life.\\n\\nIn conclusion, career identification is an important part of the high school experience. It can help students enjoy learning and stay motivated to achieve their goals. Additionally, having a career commitment can lead to a successful future. Whether students choose a career in the arts or STEM, it is important for them to take the time to explore their options and make an informed decision about their future. By doing so, they can set themselves up for success and achieve their dreams.',\n",

At first this was a very succesful and popular image, a section from the article states that \" The Face On Mars has becoma a pop icon, that starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk show and even haunted stores for 25 years\". this states that this photo was a clear sign of Extarestrial life, at least at the time.\\n\\nAlthough many people beleived this theory was a Alien artifact it was eventually disproven on April 5, 1998 as shown on the article \"And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all\".\\n\\nAllthough many people still believe that scientists must have missed something and that it really is a allien artifact sorry to burtst your bubble but, you are wrong. See Scientists have been working on this theory for very many years they have gone back and looked at it multiple times, retaken pictures from multiple different angles, Enlarged x3 and still the only thing there is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa.\\n\\nOn april 8, 2001 a Mars Global surveyor drew close enough for a second look. They then rolled the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view, Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera\\'s absolute maximum resolution. \"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 156 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1978 Viking photo\".\\n\\nSo from all of the information from this article it is confirmed that \"The Face\" isn\\'t really a extraterestrial artifact, but just a measly illusion.

       " \"When I have a problem. I like to ask multiple people for advice. That is one of the best ways I figure my problems out. An opinion can have a large affect on me. Depending on who that person is. Honestly, I think people should ask more than one person for advice. When a person in general has a problem. I like to think that two thoughts go through their mind. One, I should figure this problem out in my own. Two, I should ask more than one person for their opinion.\\n\\nIf someone were to listen to them self, they might make the wrong choice. In my opinion, humans tend avoid the things they don't want to do. That could be doing homework, cleaning or making dinner. When it comes to making a decision, you could could be put in a difficult situation. Putting pressure on someone, to make the best choice. Most people offend over think\\xa0situations. They delay the decision they were going to make. Then they end up listening to them self. Not thinking about the other people involved in the matter. When they really should think about the other people involved.\\n\\nAsking a variety of people, is more helpful than you would think. Especially if someone were to ask older people. I say that because of the experience they might have. They have been on this earth for a long time. Seeing the changes that have happened over time. It is possible that the person you happen to ask, has been through the same thing or something close to it. An example would be parents. In the end they only want what's best for you. Not to repeat the mistakes they may have made in their life. They can give some great advice.\\n\\nPsychologically, I think it takes a large toll out of a person's brain. Not telling anyone the problems someone might have, or asking for advice. If someone starts to chose one decision. Then decides to go back and think about the other decisions they may have. It could possibly render the first decision useless. If they decide their first choice was not correct.\\xa0Leaving that person lost. Not knowing what the right choice is. Keeping that person thinking about the problem for hours and not letting them move on. If you don't tell anyone about the problems you may have. How are they supposed to know? How are they supposed to help you work things out? Asking multiple can help you make a faster decision. Without as much stress involved.\\n\\nThink of all the positive out comes that can come from asking multiple people for advice. You won't have to worry as much, you will be prepared, and you will let people know what's going on in your life. If it was something extremely bad. Asking a person for advice can help you get away from that situation. Be bullied would be an example of that. It doesn't have to be a bad thing either. If it was someones birthday. You could ask someone for their preference. If you wanted to buy them a gift.\\n\\nThat's why I think it's important for people to ask more than one person for advice. They can help save you from making the wrong decision or spending to much time thinking about it. It also not somthing that you only get advice for something that is bad. It can be helpful tips. People need to depend on each other once in awhile. By the experiences that other people may have. They can tell you stories of there life and how to prepare for next time you may have a problem.\\xa0\",\n",

       " 'Students every year are increasing from skipping school. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I think students should all have an option to learn from home. Some people can work better with online classes or videos. Students are sometimes not in the mood to go to school or see some other people at school, if so they could stay home and learn there with their classes.\\n\\nSome people can work better with online classes or videos. It can help kids if they dont really like there classes or if they are very independent. This is very neat and i think a lot of students would benefit off of it. Expertise\\xa0now with this new technology some people like working on the laptops so they would like if they could sit at home and work on class. Students can also not worry about getting up early and getting dressed for school, they can just get up and get on there laptop and do there class work.\\n\\nStudents arent happy to go to school all the time, but with this option they can do they classes online or watch videos about there classes. At home students can be conflictual\\xa0and safer. The work at home can be nice they can take breaks and eat food whenever they want, therefore they would still have to work on there class work.\\n\\nhowever, student could always get distracted and not do there work. They can also choose just to take a day off at home so there should be a parent near to push them. Parents should be near the student while doing work so they can see what they are working on and help them if needed.\\n\\nSo i think thats why we should have an option if students should have online classes at home or watch videos about there classes. either or is a good thing i like the idea. Some people still like going to school so that is fine too. Like i said early parents should be in on this and be there with there kids if they do choose to stay home.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0',\n",
       " ' While some students believe that online classes are a better option than traditional classroom learning, there are several reasons why taking classes in person is ultimately more beneficial.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, students who take online classes may struggle to find assistance when they encounter problems. Without a teacher available to help them, they may not be able to complete their work on time, resulting in lower grades. In contrast, when students take classes in person, they have access to teachers who can provide guidance and support when needed.\\n\\nAnother issue with online classes is that students may not have reliable internet access at home. This can make it difficult for them to submit their work on time, as they may experience technical difficulties or slow internet speeds. On the other hand, when students take classes in person, they do not need to rely on their internet connection to complete their work.\\n\\nIn addition to these practical considerations, there are also benefits to learning in person that cannot be replicated online. For example, students who take classes in person have the opportunity to interact with their peers and engage in discussions that can deepen their understanding of the material. They can also benefit from the social and emotional support that comes from being part of a community of learners.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while online classes may seem like a convenient option, there are several reasons why taking classes in person is ultimately more beneficial for students. By having access to teachers and reliable internet, and by benefiting from the social and emotional support that comes from being part of a community of learners, students can achieve better grades, a deeper understanding of the material, and a more fulfilling learning experience.',\n",
       " \"Hey, so I'm gonna write about this thing where some people think that high school should only take three years instead of four. Like, I don't know if I agree with that, but I guess it's a thing some people are saying.\\n\\nSo, one issue is that if you finish high school faster, you might not have as much time to explore your interests and passions. Like, maybe you're not sure what you want to do after high school, but you need more time to figure it out. Or maybe you want to try out different extracurriculars or clubs, but you don't have the time if you're in school for less time.\\n\\nAnother thing is that if you finish high school faster, you might not have as much time to develop your social skills. Like, you know how you make friends in high school and stuff? Well, if you finish faster, you might not have as much time to hang out with your friends and make new ones. And that can be tough, especially if you're moving on to college or whatever after high school.\\n\\nAnd then there's the issue of college readiness. Like, if you finish high school faster, you might not be as prepared for college as you could be. I mean, you still gotta take the SAT or ACT and stuff, but if you don't have as much time to study for it, you might not do as well. And that could make it harder to get into the college you want.\\n\\nSo, what can we do about it? Well, one thing is that schools could offer more classes or programs that help students explore their interests and passions. Like, maybe there could be more electives or clubs or whatever. And maybe schools could offer more support for students who are struggling with college readiness. Like, maybe there could be more tutoring or test prep or something.\\n\\nAnother thing is that schools could offer alternative paths for students who finish high school faster. Like, maybe there could be more online or vocational programs that students can take instead of traditional high school. That way, students can still learn stuff and get ready for college or whatever, but they can do it at their own pace.\\n\\nSo, yeah, that's my take on it.

       " 'In recent years, many states have passed laws in which drivers are not allowed to use their cell phones while driving. Georgia, in particular, passed the Hands Free Law in 2018; this helped establish that phones cannot be used while driving, only when the car is parked. Since the release of this law, accidents due to phones have greatly diminished. Although in today\\'s society cell phone have become a critical part of everyone\\'s life, they have also become the epitome of distraction and addiction. The dependence people have on their phones has become so great that they are willing to risk their lives, driving blind for a couple seconds, going 60 mph, just to text back \" LOL.\"\\n\\nAlthough these law are in place, they still don\\'t stop people from checking their notifications on their phones. Even with a two second checking of ones phone, it can cause their chances of crashing to become higher. If you are driving at 55mph and you looking away for 5 seconds, it\\'ll be like driving the distance of a football field. This means that you possess a large risk to not only yourself, but everyone driving around you. 1.6 million people each year are involved in car crashes and a large portion of these crashes are due to cell phone usage.\\n\\nOne of the obvious consequences of texting and driving is one\\'s inevitable death. Texting and driving, or just merely scrolling through your notifications puts yourself and others at risk since it\\'s basically like driving blindfolded for a couple seconds. But people don\\'t realize this, they\\'ll see a clear road and then decide to pick up their phones. However, anything can happen within those few seconds. Texting and driving poses a threat to others on the road as well, so even if the car crash wasnt fatal on your end, you could have taken someone else\\'s life. Another consequence of texting and driving involves non-fatal injuries. Although some car crashes on non-fatal, injuries are prevalent. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. A broken arm, concussion, lacerations, are some of the many injuries that are common after a collision. But there are some injuries that are far worse. Some people end up paralyzed, mute, and some even lose recollections of past memories. Imagine forgetting who you were, your family and friends, all for a simple text message.\\n\\nOn a different note, these car accidents are indeed preventable. States like Georgia are stepping up and passing laws to reduce the number of car accidents with the hands-free law. As previously mentioned, the number of car accidents have declined. Fatal crashes were down 6 percent in 2018, said Harris Blackwood, director of the Georgia Governor\\'s Office of Highway Safety. And for those who are caught using their phone while driving are given a pretty hefty fine. Additionally, on a more market scale, there are hands free devices available for purchase such as bluetooth earphones for calls and windshield phone mounts. Furthermore, the newer cars that are coming out are now embedding technology into the cars system to prevent drivers from using their phone. Drivers can easily browse through music, answer phone calls, and navigate to their desired destination.\\n\\nA life can be lost by simply responding to a text or peeping at a notification. It\\'s not worth it to risk your life just because you decided to look at your phone for a couple seconds. It\\'s also not worth it to be on life support the rest of your life because you were recording a video to upload on snap that never ended up being uploaded. You also have the life of others in your hands when you make the decision to use your cellular device while driving. It\\'s like driving under the influence but you\\'re blindfolded. Life is already short to be texting and driving. It can wait, it\\'s better to come home to your family than to not come home at all.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nCampbell, Sarah Fay. \"Hands-Free Law: Drop in Fatal Crashes, Mostly Mixed Results.\" Northwest Georgia News, 1 Jan. 2019, www. northwestgeorgianews. com/region/news/hands-free-law-drop-in-fatal-crashes-mostly-mixed-results/article_19db27c6-0e1f-11e9-8435-176b758fe77d. html.\\n\\n\"How Much Does the Average CA Car Crash Cost?\" Liljegren Law Group, 24 Oct. 2018, www. liljegrenlaw. com/economic-cost-car-accidents-global-us-state/.\\n\\nAaron. \"Hands-Free Cars Take Wheel, and Law Isn\\'t Stopping Them.\" The New York Times, The New York Times, 2 May 2015, www. nytimes. com/2015/05/03/business/hands-free-cars-take-wheel-and-law-isnt-stopping-them. html\\n\\n\"Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving.\" Edgarsnyder. com, Edgar Snyder & Associates, www. edgarsnyder. com/car-accident/cause-of-accident/cell-phone/cell-phone-statistics. html.\\n\\n3      ',\n",

I think this because it's a great way to get some exercise, meet new people, and have fun.\\n\\nFirst of all, playing a sport in a community park is a great way to get some exercise. Running around and playing games outside can help you stay healthy and fit. It's also a lot of fun! You get to run around and play with your friends, which makes it feel less like exercise and more like a fun activity. Plus, you don't have to worry about getting bored or feeling like you're missing out on something else to do.\\n\\nAnother reason why playing a sport in a community park is so enjoyable is that you get to meet new people. When you're playing a sport, you're surrounded by other people who are also there to have fun and get some exercise. This means you get to make new friends and connect with people who have similar interests. It's also a great way to learn new skills and techniques from other players.\\n\\nFinally, playing a sport in a community park is just plain fun! There's something about being outside and enjoying nature that makes it feel like a special treat. You get to breathe in fresh air, feel the sun on your face, and hear the sounds of birds chirping and children laughing. It's a great way to relax and unwind after a long day of school.\\n\\nOverall, playing a sport in a community park is an enjoyable way to spend time outdoors because it's a great way to get exercise, meet new people, and have fun. So next time you're looking for something to do outside, consider grabbing a ball and heading to your local community park!\",\n",

       " \"It's a good idea for students to graduate of three years of high school instead of taking for years, i think if they have already passed their classes then they would not have to take elective classes and they might be able to graduate early, but if they need more then seven classes then they might do not be able to graduate and they will have to come during summer to complete their classes that they need to pass.\\n\\nFor example if they are still missing some of the work they had to complete at the end of the year they would have to come during summer school or maybe take more classes then what they were allow to be taking.\\n\\nIf they need to complete more work they might come during summer break, i think it would be good if you have all your classes that you need in order to graduate since when you come to ninth grade, so at the end of high school you might just come to skool just for maybe two classes and it would be better for you becase you need to pass all your classes either way in order to graduate.\\n\\nand you are assigned with seven SOL and one for english actually you have to be able to pass all the work that youre assigned you must complete all these before you go to the 12th grade, because if you dont complete these assignments before thatnthen you will strugle with these at the end of the senior year of high school, but if you complete all your work that means that you are ready to graduate.\\n\\nFor example i am taking four classes that i need to graduate, but i am taking three elective classes because i wanted to learn more, and i did not want to go home early, so i told my counselour i wanted to get three more classes, but it is because i took all the classes i needed to take during the freshman, sophomore and junior year, so now that i am in twelve grade i just have to take just four main classes with are the ones i need in order to graduate.\\n\\nEven tho it would have been a good idea to come in summer because i can learn more, but also would not be a good idea because then i would not be able to graduate on time, or mostly like i would have to come to turn in the work i did not finish during school year, and that would b bad because i want to graduate on time just like the other people that passed all theur classes so i need to put that effort and see or talk with the teacher and ask them what do ni need in order to pass all my classes if i am missing some work i have to turn it in.\\n\\nI want to complete all the work due on time because if i do not turn in the work i am assigned to do then that would affect my grades and that will take me away from graduation, wich i have been waiting for since ninth grade,\\n\\nSo i think it is good to complete your work in class, or if you have homework assigned then we must complete it, or like sometimes the teachers put some work in google classroom with dates due, so we must turn the work on time and complete all of it, becase if we do not do it our grades are going to go down and that means we will not be passing the classes that we need to pass and that will not let us walk in the stage\\n\\nWe must complete all the work, if we do complete all that is assigned then we will be good and would not have to worry about our grades because the grades will be good too, that is why i say that we need to complete the work and sometimes pay attention to what the teacher is explaining that helps us to understand and make the work easy, but if we do not pay attention, at the end of the day or at the end of the class we will have problems with the understanding of the theme we have studied in class because we did not pay attention in class while the teacher was explaining.\\n\\nOne of the examples of not paying attention in class is, what is going to come next like we are going to get very bad grades, so we must do all the work listen while someone is giving instructions because that way we would not have problems with anything and when the test comes up we are going to be prepared to take it and get high grades, because we already studied and if we review our work before we turn it in and make sure everything is good and in order so we would get a good grades.\\n\\nSo other reason why we get good grades is if we come to school everyday because if we miss more then ten days we will get suspended and that will mess up your grades because you are abnsent and you will not be able to see or work in the class wich is better because if you do not come to school for couple of weeks then you will not know when you come back to school, you will be lost because you have already missed some of the work we already did while you was not here, so for me i rather coming to shool even though i am sick or something because otherwise i will bring my grades down and one missing day of school will make all my work come down or bring all my classes down because i have been absent and when i come back to school i would not know what to do.\\n\\nIt is good to keep your grades up and stay them in the same level because that will help ypu tp graduate, so one of my examples is if i come to school and complete all my work, then i do not have to worry about my grades, but ut is not only about your grades or what you do in class is also about what we get in the test and that will be product of the work and effort we put in class if we did good in our notes or study guides that means we will be great in the test too because it is the same that we learn in class it is all the same what will come in the test, so we need to stay focused and ask for help the teacher if we do not understand what we are doing in class.\\n\\nThe teachers are able to help in anything we want, well if it is about the classwork because sometimes we do not understand at all but we can review work and try the best for the next class, we always need to make sure our work is complete before we turn it in because if you have a small mistake that will bring your grades down too and we will not pass our classes and make sure complete everything, in order to graduate.\",\n",

Between this group of people we can find students that were in school in their countries, but when they come into this country and they get in high school, as a result of the \"bad\" education from certain countries, these students are settled in grades where they should not be because of their age and learning capacity.

Other students think about the possibility to go to college out of the country because of the high cost of them, but they still have to work and get extra money.\\n\\nThe departament of education of the United States is encharge for all these changes and they should take this option because it would benefit people, would benefit the country, and will benefit students in general.\\n\\nThe program could work if students stay after school or they come at night, this would give them more opportunities to make a plan where they can work hard to reduce their time in high school, it is really important to keep on mind that many students already work in their free time and they might not be able to do an extra time in high school, that is why this offer should be analyzed in order to the student benefit, but at the same time giving the enough amount of knowledge they will need.',\n",

However, if a student has a grade of F or D or below, they should be informed that they are no longer eligible to participate in their activity until they improve their grades.\\n\\nThis change is necessary because it ensures that students are held accountable for their academic performance and that they are not allowed to prioritize their extracurricular activities over their studies. It also encourages students to strive for excellence in both their academic and extracurricular pursuits, which can lead to a well-rounded education and personal growth.\\n\\nI understand that some students may feel discouraged or frustrated by this change, but it's important to remember that academic success is the foundation of any successful future. By prioritizing academic excellence, we are setting our students up for success in all areas of their lives.\\n\\nI welcome any feedback or suggestions from students and parents regarding this change. It's important to work together to ensure that our school is providing the best possible education for our students.\",\n",
       " \"An employer's decision to hire a candidate is based on many components, one of which is experience. While having extensive experience can often make an individual a top pick for a job opening, employers also benefit from considering applicants who have little to no experience. Those who lack experience have fewer preconceived notions about the job and can bring fresh perspectives to challenges. Additionally, they can be trained more quickly and cost-effectively. \\n\\nAspiring employees who have limited or no experience can succeed by demonstrating their hard work, diligent study, and dedication to the job. During an interview, candidates should highlight their unique strengths and explain how their ambition and eagerness to learn can be an advantage. Moreover, having them focus on the skills and characteristics that can be acquired through the job itself can help potential employers to accurately assess them for the role.\\n\\nNevertheless, should an employer incorrectly judge potential employees based on experience alone, it could lead to hiring the wrong candidate. Therefore, it is important for employers to holistically assess each candidate's skillset to determine who would be the best fit for the job.\",\n",

It's smart to make kids get better grades to participate in after school sports because if they really want to do the sports then there going to want to get better grades and to do well in school.\\n\\nIts great for the school and its great for the students to get great grades.\\n\\nThe students that do not agree with this policy will not earn the right to play sports, so its either get good grades and play or get bad grades and not play.\\n\\nYou could reduce the amount of kids that do not agree with this policy maybe if you don't make it sound like a challenge and you make it sound fun to get B' s in school You could even hold an after school sports activity for getting the highest grade in your class and hold a competition amongst these students. Also good grades also lead to good behavior so that is another reason to stick with your policy. This might even make school a fun place for students who hate it or think it's boring.\\n\\nIn the future you should try to get students with B pluses and A' s to play in school sports so you keep pushing them to get the higher grades.

       " \"The debate over implementing a four-day work week in schools is an ongoing discussion in the education system. While many view the change with optimism, there are also several disadvantages associated with reduced school hours. This essay will aim to analyze opinions from all stakeholders in the school district, considering the effects of such a policy both socially and financially. \\n\\nThe most obvious benefit of a four-day work week in schools is the potential of increased productivity. Students would be able to spend more time with their families and pursue leisure activities that are not available during regular school hours, leading to improved physical and mental health. Advocates of the policy also mention that a day off can serve as a reward for students who perform well in classes. \\n\\nHowever, several considerations need to be made before implementing such a policy. Parents and other staff members may have difficulties providing additional childcare or transportation services on the extra day. Teachers would also have to find more creative ways to fit a full week's worth of material into four days. Furthermore, there could be significant financial consequences to such a decision, including increased energy consumption and reduced wages for hourly-based employees. \\n\\nIt is important to understand that the decision to implement a four-day work week in schools is a complicated one. All stakeholders in the school district need to voice their opinions and come together to find a compromise that works for everyone involved.\",\n",
       " \"Hey, so for this essay, I gotta analyze the pros and cons of a long summer break for students. I think it's pretty cool that we get like three months off from school, but there are some downsides too.\\n\\nOne pro is that we can review what we learned during the school year. Like, I totally forgot how to do long division, so I can go over it during the summer and get better at it. And if I didn't do so well in a certain class, I can use the summer to catch up or even take summer school to get better grades. That way, when school starts again, I'll be all set.\\n\\nBut, there are some cons too. Like, my family is always super busy during the summer. My parents work, my little brother is always getting into stuff, and my dog needs attention. So, it's hard to find time to do my homework or study for tests. And if I don't keep up with my schoolwork, I'll fall behind. That's no good.\\n\\nAnother con is that we don't get to see our friends as much. Like, we'll see them at the beginning of the year, but then we don't see them again until the next year. And sometimes, we don't even get to hang out during the summer because our families are too busy. That's really sad because I love my friends.\\n\\nOh, and there's this other option called year-round school. I don't know if it's a good or bad thing, but I heard it's where you go to school almost all year round instead of just the traditional summer break. I'm not sure how that would work, but I think it might be cool to have more time to learn stuff.\\n\\nSo, overall, I think the long summer break is pretty cool, but it's important to use that time wisely. I don't want to fall behind in my schoolwork or forget everything I learned during the year. And I definitely don't want to miss out on seeing my friends. But, I guess it's a trade-off. Maybe if we didn't have such a long summer break, we could learn more stuff throughout the year and not feel so overwhelmed when school starts again.\\n\\nI\",\n",

While some argue for a shift to election by popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College has several significant advantages that should not be overlooked. In this letter, I will outline the benefits of the Electoral College, address counterarguments, and provide evidence from various sources to support my claims.\\n\\nFirstly, one of the key advantages of the Electoral College system is the certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This ensures that the elected president has majority support across different regions of the country, preventing candidates from merely focusing on highly populated areas and neglecting the interests of smaller states (Posner, 18). By requiring candidates to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign and address the concerns of voters from all parts of the country (Posner, 19).\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College safeguards against the possibility of run-off elections. Unlike in countries with direct popular vote systems, the Electoral College ensures that a clear winner is selected without the need for further elections. This prevents the process from being drawn out and complicated, as seen in other countries. For instance, the 1968 and 1992 elections had candidates who won the presidency with only a plurality of the popular vote, but still secured a majority in the Electoral College (Posner, 22). The Electoral College acts as a safeguard against prolonged and potentially chaotic election processes.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College gives smaller states a fair voice in the election. As Judge Posner explains, the large states already have an advantage in terms of representation in the Senate due to the Constitution's mal-apportionment. By awarding electoral votes based on population, the Electoral College restores the balance of political weight, ensuring that smaller states are not underrepresented (Posner, 21).\\n\\nWhile some argue that the Electoral College is unfair and outdated, it is important to consider the practical reasons for its continuation. As mentioned by the Office of the Federal Register, the Electoral College was established as a compromise between election by Congress and direct popular vote (Federal Register, 1). It offers a middle ground that combines the benefits of both methods.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College system is beneficial for the United States as it guarantees certainty of outcome, ensures trans-regional appeal, focuses attention on swing states, restores balance for large states, and avoids run-off elections. Despite the occasional criticisms and calls for change, the Electoral College system has stood the test of time and has proven to be a fair and effective method for electing the President of the United States.\\n\\nThank you for considering my perspective. I trust that you will carefully contemplate the advantages of the Electoral College system before supporting any potential changes.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]\",\n",

If they do take it into school they should keep it in there locker or off in there pockets if they bring it into class. I think this is a great idea because kids could just pull it out of there pocket and start using it when the teacher is not looking or paying attention. For example kids in my school play with there phones when the teacher is not paying attention or looking then they laugh about what's on there phone so then the teacher has to stop teaching and r remove the phone from the kids and then the teacher keeps it till the end of the day.

The cars that already have been created are not completely driverless. That means you still have to pay full attention when the car is working by itself.\\n\\nGoogle had a car that could drive half a million miles without crashing but it still wasn\\'t driverless . The driver gets notified when pulling in and out of driveways. The Google cars would also alert the driver incase of a accident or roadwork .\\n\\nSome of the cars made had sensors in them. The sensors would allow a much better respond than the human drivers . BMW \"Traffic Jam Assistant\" had a sensor that would make sure the driver had hold of the wheel. Most of the cars developed so far couldn\\'t really do much but steer,accelerate, and brake themselves. The human driver still had to remain alert incase they had to take over and start driving in case of an accident or roadwork ahead .\\n\\nSo why would anyone want a driveless car that still needs a driver? They think the idea of it is fun , which it is . Most laws about driving are focused on keeping the people in the vehicle safe. New laws will be made incase there is an accident .

       " 'Cellphones in the classroom can have a marked effect on student success, both positive and negative. Although having a tool for information available can be beneficial, it can also be a distraction from the important task at hand—learning and engaging in academic pursuits. \\n\\nThree key effects of having a cellphone in the classroom are decreased attention to the teacher, inappropriate usage for non-educational purposes, and disruption of the classroom environment. Not listening to the teacher eliminates the opportunity to learn and participate in a meaningful way, leading to decreased academic success. Additionally, if students are using their phone for non-educational purposes, such as playing games or sending messages, this takes away from focus on educational tasks. Finally, when the classroom environment is consistently disrupted by the noise and visual distraction that accompanying cellphone use, the learning experience is compromised. \\n\\nAlthough there are potential benefits of having a cellphone in the classroom, people should not use cellphones for non-educational purposes.

It is a very unacceptable practice to trap people in school and force them to participate in activities after school ends. I believe that extracurricular activities should not be mandatory because they can increase stress in students and teachers, costs more money for labor, and wastes the students' precious time. It would be devastating if the school started to require students to take at least one extracurricular activity.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the addition of mandatory extracurricular activities would, in fact, induce plenty of stress in students and teachers. This is true because it creates more things that they have to worry about. In addition, increasing the required work time at school can also cause people to feel stressed out by increasing the amount of bullying that can occur. Not giving the students and teachers enough time at home to work can result in added worrying because they are now forced to suddenly improve in managing their time more than ever. School needs to be a safe and stress free environment if they want students to thrive later on in life.\\n\\nNext, prolonging the period that a school is open for will most certainly increase the expenditure of money from the school. This is true because the school would need to pay the teachers more money to work for longer periods of time. The school would also need to pay more money for their bills due to the increase in used electricity and water. Another negative effect of this would be the fact that more utensils and other supplies would be used, resulting in the need to buy and replenish this supply more frequently. In addition, the school would also need to pay for better sanitation if the building is going to be in use for longer periods of time.\\n\\nLastly, making extracurricular activities mandatory would become a huge waste of time. This is because students and teachers have lives outside of school too. In addition, It is not morally correct to keep people in the school to force them to do activities against their will. I would also like to add that it is unlikely that the school would be able to provide every activity that would fulfill the needs of students. I believe this is true because each and every person has their own needs and it wouldn't be fair to keep them trapped in school if the school likely won't be able to provide with solutions to those needs.\\n\\nAll in all, I believe that after school activities should not be required because they induce stress, costs more money to pull off, and wastes the precious time that students have. Not convinced yet? Imagine not having time after school to participate in activities. Now imagine being forced to stay in school for an extra two hours. In addition, people would need to participate in these activities every single day. Schools cannot and must not make this rule a reality.\",\n",

It sometimes can be use for just certain things and if that person gives you permission to look at the Site, then yeah it can be used to determine how they are feeling. Some people may think this new technology may be an awesome technology but some other people may also think that is just as same as other technology. For example, \"If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.\" This means that this technology mostly works only when your smile like it said on the text. Yeah it may be awesome to other people but like i said it should be banned because there is no point on having that techology if that person tells you how they are felling.

       " \"Dear Mr. principle\\n\\nI think that we should be able to have cell phones in class as long as we don't use them when the teacher are talking maybe at the end of class when there is only a few minutes left. We should be able to use them during passing periods because it not like we are class it is not like cell phones are harmful its just teachers do not want it being a disruption in class. Really I understand that but i think that the policy is to strict when it comes to having cell phones in class or in the hallways. another place i think that we should be able to have them is in the cafeteria because we are sitting there having lunch and i think that we should be able to look at our cell phones. there are going to be times that a cell phone might brake or something you just need to simply let everyone know that they need to use there cell phones at the appropriate time and that if it broken or stolen that you or anyone else is not responsible for it. if it starts becoming a issue where students are taking it out during class when they are not suppose to you can deal with it a few ways. one way that u can deal with it is take there cell phone away and say that they can not take it to class again and if they do it again that there parents will have to pick it up. another way you could go about it is having like a bucket the teacher can hold on to it till the end of class and if it happens again it would be sent down to the principles office. all kids would have to keep there phones on silent. Teachers would be able to use there cell phones to but at the appropriate time. i think that it would be very cool if we could all use our cell phones in class. some kids have music on there cell phones and they can listen to that at the end of class. not out loud of course it would have to be with there ear buds. I fell as if schools are so against cell phones that it is almost like i bad thing i think that if we were to open up about them and start letting kids use them then it might change how students work and maybe they will pay more attention in class because they are not trying to be sneaky with there cell phone. some kids d worry that having there phones on there locker that it might get stolen if they are picked on or something. they will think if someone is going to break into there locker or something. I really do not think that it should be that one person messes with the policy then everyone has the privileged ruined for them because the one who is following the rules is going to be mad that another person ruined it for them and trust me they will not be a happy camper. those are my reasons why i think we should be able to have a cell phone in class.\",\n",

       " 'Cars have become an important part of our lives. They are convenient, fast and comfortable. However, excessive car usage is harmful to the environment and our health. Therefore, limiting car usage has numerous advantages that we can all benefit from.\\n\\nFirstly, limiting car usage can reduce air pollution. Cars emit harmful gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, which can cause respiratory problems and other health issues. By using public transportation or walking and biking, we can reduce the number of cars on the road and the amount of harmful emissions in the air.\\n\\nSecondly, limiting car usage can reduce traffic congestion. Traffic jams can cause frustration, wasted time and increased fuel consumption. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can ease traffic congestion and make our commutes more efficient.\\n\\nLastly, limiting car usage can save money. Cars are expensive to maintain and fuel. By using public transportation or walking and biking, we can save money on fuel, maintenance and parking costs. In addition, public transportation is often more affordable than owning and maintaining a car.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages that we can all benefit from. It can reduce air pollution, traffic congestion and save money. Therefore, we should all consider using public transportation or walking and biking instead of relying on our cars for every trip. By doing so, we can improve our health, save time and money and protect the environment.',\n",
       " \"When people ask for advice, they should talk to more than one person because it can help them make a better choice. If someone only talks to one person, they might get a biased opinion and miss out on other options. By seeking multiple opinions, they can get different perspectives and consider more possibilities.\\n\\nFor example, let's say I'm trying to decide which sport to play this season. If I only ask my soccer-loving friend for advice, she'll probably tell me to join the soccer team. But if I ask my basketball-loving friend too, he might suggest I try out for the basketball team. By talking to both of them, I can weigh the pros and cons of each sport and make a more informed decision.\\n\\nAnother reason to seek multiple opinions is that different people have different experiences and knowledge. My mom might have good advice about school-related problems, but my dad might be better at giving advice about friendships. By talking to both of them, I can get the best of both worlds and make a better choice.\\n\\nIn conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it gives them different perspectives and allows them to consider more possibilities.

So, I know I'm not the most outgoing person in my class, and sometimes that makes me feel like I'm being judged by my peers. I want to change that! I want to be more confident in myself and my abilities, so I can make a better first impression.\\n\\nFirst, I did some research on how to gain confidence. I found out that it's all about believing in yourself and your worth. It's easy to get caught up in what others think of us, but we have to remember that our worth comes from within. So, I started by looking within myself and figuring out what makes me unique and special. I realized that I have a lot of great qualities that I can be proud of, like my creativity and my sense of humor.\\n\\nNext, I came up with a plan of action. I decided to take small steps every day to work on building my confidence. For example, I started by smiling at people I pass in the hallway, even if I don't know them. It sounds silly, but it's a start! I also started speaking up in class more, instead of just sitting quietly and hoping no one notices me. It's hard, but it's worth it.\\n\\nBut, I know it's not going to be easy. There are definitely challenges that come up when you try to change your first impression. Like, what if people don't respond the way I want them to? What if they still see me as the shy kid in the back of the class? It can be discouraging, but I know I can't let that stop me. I'm going to keep working on building my confidence and trying new things. Maybe I'll even join a club or group that aligns with my interests, like JROTC. That way, I can meet new people who share my passions and maybe even make some new friends.\\n\\nIn conclusion, changing my first impression is going to take time and effort, but I'm willing to put in the work. I know that by believing in myself and my worth, and taking small steps every day, I can become more confident and make a better first impression. It's not going to be easy, but\",\n",
       " ' If you ask people \"When do you feel successful?\". Most of them can respond that they feel successful when they have achieved their goals and have fewer problems and failures. But what is on the other side of this success? How do people achieve it? Nobody can tell the whole process of becoming successful. But why?\\n\\nEveryone has gone through a difficult, challenging path to achieve their goals. It wasn\\'t easy, and it was hard when they tried to achieve their goals. Successful people didn\\'t have an easy path to success. Failure is an examination, a challenge for us when we are trying to stay successful. Successful people must pass all kinds of failure exams to show that they are strong, sturdy, and patient. Success doesn\\'t like weak and whiny people.\\n\\nFor example, famous people like musicians and composers: Bach, Mozart, Beethoven; writers like Shakespeare, Stendal, Tolstoy, and Pushkin; scientists like Einstein and Tesla. They are all famous now because, in their time, they had a goal: to be successful and do the things that they loved by their soul and heart. They had failures and opponents, people who just hated and envied them. And now, you can only imagine how much enthusiasm and passion we know about them now, in our time. They are examples of successful people for us now.\\n\\nNobody of famous and successful people tells you that it was an easy path to success. Because it is true. And everyone has different failures; you can\\'t feel those failures like they feel them. And nobody can tell you that the path to success will be easy. It is a very big number of people who pray to achieve their goals, but with the first failures, they just stopped and went back, and they lost their enthusiasm.

You mustn\\'t be afraid to see with your eyes your failure. You must be strong.\" And I think they can find some strength.\\n\\nThere are many meetings, conferences, and seminars with successful and famous people in some way.

       " \"Phones and Driving, should it be a thing? Today over 5 billion people own a mobile device, and a little over 1 billion own some sort of vehicle.\\n\\nThese are two of the things people feel they need in life. But maybe the use of both at once is a bit too overwhelming. Driving while texting, or even making a phone call is excessive. It can be dangerous and hurt people in multiple ways. Phone usage while driving should be prohibited in every state, country and continent!\\n\\nUsing a phone while driving a vehicle should not be allowed anywhere! It can cause many accidents. It can also bring troubles and pain to ones family.\\n\\nFor example, in February 2018, a 17 year old in Alabaster, Alabama killed a ten year old and her father in an accident because the teen was texting while driving. If the teen would have been paying attention to the road and not their phone the accident maybe could have been prevented. Not saying all accidents are caused by phone use, but a majority of them are.\\n\\nGenerally there are 1.6 million crashes involving texting and driving. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents involving texting and driving. 4,637 people died in the year 2018 because of the accidents. If that does not scare one into not using their phone while driving, then I don't know what will. This is one of the many reasons why I believe driving and the use of a phone should be banned!\\n\\nAnother reason cell phone use while driving should be banned; if adults use their phone while operating a vehicle their children will possibly be strongly influenced by it. The children will start to think it is okay to do so. It is the year 2019 and all that this generation raves about is having a car and the newest IPhone if we are taught that it is okay to text and drive, someone can earnestly get hurt by these actions. Most accidents involve teen driving, we don't want to give them another reason to be absentminded while driving.\\n\\nThe use of a mobile device while operating a vehicle should be prohibited. Now is the time to admit that driving while using a phone or any mobile devices is dangerous! You wouldn't want you or a loved one to end up critically injured, dead or disabled. Phone usage while driving is one of the many reasons accidents happen everyday. You can always wait until you are out of the car to make that call or answer that text !   \",\n",
       " \"Distance learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, with many students opting to learn from the comfort of their own homes. While this can be a convenient option, it can also come with its own set of challenges, particularly when it comes to distractions. In this essay, I will analyze how distance learning can affect students due to distractions such as video games, phones, or lack of sleep.\\n\\nOne of the biggest challenges of distance learning is staying focused and avoiding distractions. With the internet at our fingertips, it can be easy to get sidetracked by social media, video games, or other online activities. For some students, these distractions can be particularly tempting, as they may not have the same level of accountability as they would in a traditional classroom setting. Without the constant monitoring of a teacher, it can be easy to procrastinate and fall behind on assignments.\\n\\nAnother challenge of distance learning is maintaining a healthy work-life balance. With the flexibility of learning from home, it can be easy to blur the lines between work and personal time. This can lead to students working long hours and neglecting their own needs, such as getting enough sleep or taking breaks. Without the structure of a traditional school schedule, it can be difficult for students to maintain a healthy routine and ensure that they are getting the rest and relaxation they need to succeed.\\n\\nIn addition to these challenges, distance learning can also affect students' mental health. Without the social interaction and support of a traditional classroom, some students may feel isolated and disconnected from their peers. This can lead to feelings of depression or anxiety, which can in turn affect their academic performance. Furthermore, the constant pressure to perform well academically can be overwhelming for some students, leading to stress and burnout.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while distance learning can be a convenient option for many students, it comes with its own set of challenges. In particular, students must be aware of the potential distractions that come with learning from home and take steps to stay focused and maintain a healthy work-life balance. By doing so, they can ensure that they are getting the most out of their distance learning experience and setting themselves up for success in the future.\",\n",
       " \"[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP Code]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator's Name]\\n[Senator's Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP Code]\\n\\nSubject: In Defense of the Electoral College\\n\\nDear [Senator's Name],\\n\\nI hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College as the method for electing the President of the United States. While I understand that there are arguments for changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides numerous benefits that outweigh any potential drawbacks.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the Electoral College system ensures a certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard Posner points out, disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are less likely compared to disputes over the popular vote. This is because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. In addition, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes in most states prevents a tie in the nationwide electoral vote. This certainty of outcome is crucial for maintaining stability and confidence in our electoral process.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College fosters a strong sense of unity and representation. By requiring presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College ensures that no single region can dominate the election. This means that a candidate with only regional support is unlikely to be successful, as they would not be able to effectively represent the interests of the entire nation. Therefore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign nationwide and develop policies that take into account the diverse needs and perspectives of various regions.\\n\\nThe system also gives more weight to swing states, which encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on these states. As a result, voters in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, be well-informed about the candidates, and make thoughtful decisions. This is important for ensuring that the most engaged and informed voters have the final say in determining the outcome of the election.\\n\\nAnother advantage of the Electoral College is that it provides representation for both large and small states. While the popular vote may favor candidates who focus solely on densely populated areas, the Electoral College guarantees that candidates must consider the interests of smaller states as well. This balance is necessary to ensure that all states have a voice and are not overwhelmed by the influence of a few densely populated areas.\\n\\nFinally, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for run-off elections, which can complicate and prolong the election process. By invariably producing a clear winner, the Electoral College provides a streamlined and efficient method for electing the President.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College has proven to be a reliable and effective mechanism for electing the President of the United States. It ensures a certainty of outcome, promotes national unity and representation, encourages attention to swing states, provides a voice for both larger and smaller states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While there may be arguments for a popular vote system, the benefits offered by the Electoral College outweigh any potential drawbacks.\\n\\nThank you for considering my viewpoint. I hope that you will continue to support the Electoral College system. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or need further information.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]\",\n",
       " 'High school graduation is a significant milestone for students, marking the end of their formal education and the beginning of a new chapter in their lives. While some students may choose to graduate in three years, others may opt for four years. The decision to graduate early or on time is influenced by various factors, including academic performance, extracurricular activities, and personal preferences.\\n\\nOne of the primary benefits of graduating high school early is that it allows students to save time and money. By completing their studies in three years, students can enter college earlier and potentially save a year of tuition and fees. Additionally, graduating early can provide students with a sense of accomplishment and a head start on their future goals.\\n\\nHowever, there are also drawbacks to graduating early. Some students may feel rushed or pressured to graduate early, which can lead to lower grades or a lack of focus on important coursework. Additionally, graduating early may limit opportunities for extracurricular activities or internships, which can be valuable for building skills and gaining work experience.\\n\\nSummer classes are another topic of debate among high school students. Some students may choose to take classes during the summer to catch up on coursework or get ahead, while others may prefer to take a break from formal education and pursue other interests.\\n\\nThere are several benefits to taking summer classes, including the ability to catch up on coursework or get ahead, the flexibility to schedule classes around personal schedules, and the opportunity to take courses that may not be offered during the regular school year. However, there are also drawbacks to taking summer classes, including the potential for burnout or fatigue, the added expense of tuition and fees, and the potential for a lack of social interaction with peers.\\n\\nElective courses are an important part of high school education, providing students with the opportunity to explore their interests and develop new skills.

We bring three houndred and thirty five horses with enough oats to feed them to the people.

But you benefit yourself by helping people in need. You also get to sightsee. At the different places you go. I got to go see the Acropolis in Athens Greece. I also took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city filled with water and finally I toured an excavated castle in Crete and marvleled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. Some other reasons are that you get to sleep in a boat you don\\'t do that very often. Finally on return trips after the animals have been unloaded you play games. We played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals were. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time.\\n\\nBut being one is more gratefull for me than an adventure. It opened up the whole world to me. \"I am gratefull for this oppurtunity\" I say \"It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.\"\\n\\nBut being a Seagoing cowboy has some dangers.

       " \"Should schools require students to do summer projects? Well I agree with this topic because, some students would want to require better learning experiences that would help them figure out ideas in the future to come; but instead of letting teachers decide we as students should be able to come up with ideas that would fit in with our learning pace. As students we would have more time to figure out everything we need in order to make a good project. Student decisions is made for a summer project.\\n\\nAs students we can talk about what we have learned in class or even at home. Making a project about nature is something you can create for your science class next school year. We would be able to show off our skills as a team in order to let the true leadership come out of everyone. We should be able to partner up with someone that is determined to learn. Doing a summer project on something you done in class would help the most because mainly we already know what we have worked on; but instead of copying basically what you know you be creative. Working as a team isnt easy or hard it will come to you if only we put our minds into it.\\n\\nSome schools have teachers that want students to better themselves for a purpose. Teachers are settings students up for if there going to college. College isnt made for everyone, some colleges give projects that have to be turned in at a certain point of time. Like writing essays or doing group activity projects. While your in school teachers want you to better yourselves to be someone that you want to be in life. You dont necessarily have to have an poster project, teachers can give you projects that doesnt deal with school it'll just better our community. Projects arent always on paper it can be something else if you or the teacher ant it to be.\\n\\nBeing able to learn during a summer break is hard, because we as children would probably have something to do, like family trips, field trips, and etc.. But if learning is something that is accomplished on its own. We can come up with projects on our own, we can be out of state and take pictures of something that fascinates us and than we could put it on a poster, or even a presentation. Being able to come to school from summer break starting a whole new year, you could talk about the amazing things you saw in a sideshow. Not knowing that we are doing a project basically everyday, it's basically life. Projects can come in many forms, but being able to do them as a team would make it more fun for school and the summer.\\n\\nWhile teachers teach and students learn, students should be able to learn on there own at some point. Teacher dont always have to give us work on there topic we should be able to come up with some good ideas that'll be creative in the learning environment. This is why I agree with students should be able to make there own decisions.\",\n",
       " 'Limiting car usage can have several advantages for both individuals and the environment. In the passage set, there are examples of communities and cities that have implemented car-free policies and have experienced positive outcomes.\\n\\nOne advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and this number can go up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the reliance on cars, communities can play a part in reducing their carbon footprint and mitigating climate change.\\n\\nAnother advantage is the improvement in air quality. In cities like Paris, where smog is a persistent problem, implementing car-free measures can significantly reduce air pollution. For example, after a five-day period of smog, Paris enforced a partial driving ban, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and an improvement in air quality. Limiting car usage can help reduce the emissions of pollutants that contribute to smog and other respiratory problems.\\n\\nAdditionally, limiting car usage can improve quality of life for individuals. In the German suburb of Vauban, where cars are generally forbidden, residents have reported feeling happier and less tense without the need for car ownership. Walking, biking, and using public transportation can contribute to a more active lifestyle and improve physical and mental well-being. It can also create a sense of community as people interact more while walking or cycling through the neighborhood.\\n\\nMoreover, limiting car usage can lead to more efficient use of space and resources. In Vauban, for example, large garages at the edge of the development serve as the only parking spaces, minimizing the need for streets and driveways. This allows for more green and communal spaces within the community. The concept of limiting car usage also promotes smart planning, where stores are placed within walking distance on a main street rather than in distant malls. This decreases the need for large parking areas and encourages a more compact and accessible community.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improvement in air quality, improved quality of life for individuals, and more efficient use of space and resources. Utilizing alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transportation can lead to a more sustainable and livable future. By implementing car-free policies and promoting smart planning, communities can contribute to a greener and healthier environment for everyone.',\n",
       " \"Everyone would like to receive praise for their work, even if the work is not their best effort, that will make them not to think low of themselves and just give up. In my opinion, true self-esteem comes from praise because it gives an individual determination, and self confidence.\\n\\nAlthough, some people believe that self-esteem comes from an achievement because it gives self-discipline; for instance, a student did a poor job on a classroom test , that means he is not receiving any praise and didn't achieve anything, but because of that he will be self-discipline, so he would do a good job next time and receive an achievement.\\n\\nI think true self-esteem come from praise because it gives an individual determination. For example, if a student gets a non pleasant grade in class, and the teacher praises the student but also tell him to do better next time, that would give the student hope and determination to do better next time.\\n\\nIn addition, true self-esteem comes from self-confidence. For instance, I am in a soccer club, but every time we practice I don't do better because I don't have the confidence, but instead of the coach cutting me off the team, he came up to me and told me that I can do better. He praised me and courage me to do better. That is going me to build self-confident in me and I would start doing better during practice.\\n\\nAccording to my reason and examples stated above, I think true self-esteem comes from praise because it gives a student determination and help build self-confidence in a student. To all the teachers, please praise a student work and let the student feel like the can do more and better.\",\n",

Your arguing with a sibling about something and both of you think you right. Your sibling goes to your parents about the situation. Both of you tell your side of the argument.

Taking the globe by storm this global phenomenon presents us with a more efficient enviornment, a huge drop in car accident tragedies, and a more functionable lifestyle.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the given: a better enviornment. Air pollution is a global issue that has become very previlant in our society today. In places such as Paris, France, extremes as far as fines for those who drive around in cars are enforced as a way to fight it's overly dense smog. Also, the president of the United States, Barrack Obama, has set a goal to curb the greenhouse gas emissions in the country. When government iniative are set to such its obvious that it's becoming an issue. If everyone begins to enforce a car free lifesyle then the world will reach a tremendous turning point and will be able to preserve our planet for the future generations.\\n\\nFurthermore, it is known that car accidents are a common occuring issue whether it be small or deadly. Intoxicated or sober accidents can be just as bad. There will be no more bikers or pedestrians being hit and need to hitch hike will no longer be an issue as well. If we remove cars form our lives then we get the advantage of putting our society in a more safe way to transport.\\n\\nFinally, car free lving will make us a more functionable lifestyle. The need of having to go so far for simple things will no longer be an issue due to the fact that everything that would be essential would be easier and closer to assess. People would begin walking more which would very much so decrease the obesity rates in many places. Also the expanison of public transportation will mean that people are more likely to have a more direct stop near the places they go.\\n\\nIn sumation, living car-lessly is a life lived less carelessly. It brings a coupious amount of advantages which means that everyone will have a safer, more funcitonable, and efficient lifestyle.    \",\n",
       " \" The debate over whether it is more beneficial to work alone or in a group has been ongoing for years. While some people believe that working alone allows them to learn how to accomplish tasks on their own and take responsibility for their work, others argue that working in a group can lead to more ideas and a shorter time to complete tasks.\\n\\nOne argument for working alone is that it allows individuals to learn how to accomplish tasks on their own. By working alone, individuals can learn how to manage their time, prioritize tasks, and take responsibility for their work. This can be especially beneficial for individuals who are just starting out in their careers or who are looking to develop specific skills.\\n\\nFor example, Thomas Edison famously invented the light bulb without asking for help. He failed many times before finally succeeding, but he was able to learn from his failures and eventually come up with a successful design. Similarly, Leonardo da Vinci spent years working on the Mona Lisa, but he was able to complete the painting on his own and without any outside help.\\n\\nHowever, working in a group can also have its benefits. When working in a group, individuals can learn from each other and bounce ideas off of each other. This can lead to more creative solutions and a faster completion time. Additionally, working in a group can provide a sense of community and support, which can be especially beneficial for individuals who are new to a particular field or who are struggling with a particular task.\\n\\nFor example, the Wright brothers were able to successfully design and build the world's first airplane by working together. They were able to combine their ideas and expertise to create a successful design. Similarly, when working on a group project at school, students can learn from each other and work together to complete the task within the given time frame.\\n\\nIn conclusion, both working alone and in a group have their benefits. Working alone can allow individuals to learn how to manage their time and take responsibility for their work, while working in a group can provide a sense of community and support and lead to more creative solutions. Ultimately, the best approach will depend on the individual and the specific task at hand.\",\n",
       " \"What do think of extracurricular activities? Usually they are programs or activities outside of work or school. In this case it's school and, not all students like doing them because they don't like to interact with others or they don't have an interest for it. Some schools require extracurricular activities and I agree because it's a chance to have new hobbies and friends.\\n\\nTo start, by doing extracurricular activities you can discover new hobbies. Some students are required to do extracurricular activities and have found a new hobby\\xa0or interest doing so. I believe it is a good thing because by having new hobbies they can also discover new career paths to go along with it. Therefore, when a student decides to get a job or when they graduate they might have some experience in that area due to the extracurricular activities. Students could also use these hobbies in their everyday life or even boost their confidence in something like SCA. However, some of these extracurricular activities are not all hobbies but, long-term thing like sports. Sports can be a good way to boost confidence and how social a student is in public, at home, and school.\\n\\nLastly, doing activities outside of school is also a great way to make friends. Activities such as sports, SCA, or any hobbies can be a good way to spark new friendships. These friends could be long or short-term but, by having friends can produce more interacting\\xa0with others and more participation in extracurricular activities. The only downside is, horsing around or being engaged in conversation while participating in activities. However, students who are not very social with others could make friends an have someone to support them when they need it. This could also benefit others participating because they could engage in conversation, depending on the activities, and have the opinion of that students.\\n\\nOverall, by doing activities outside of school students could discover new hobbies and make new friends. Extracurricular activities are not only good for what they are meant to be but, for boosting parts of a persons personality that might be low. So, next time think of an extracurricular activity as a good way to start something new.\",\n",
       " \"I think that this new rule is necessary.\\n\\nHave you ever worked to be apart of something bigger than yourself? It's a great feeling! Whether it be a group project or the school play; it's all a group effort. Everyone having at least one extracurricular activity gives us students the chance to develop their skills and talents, it'll give us experience for our future work place, and give us a chance to make ever lasting friendships bettering the group efforts.\\n\\nWorking on an extracurricular activity can help us learn talents and while developing older skills. Some students may learn important social skills and, other can develop those skills. Many students have hidden talents yet, might not ever be able to use it if they're just doing standard desk work. I hope with this new rule we can all express ourselves while learning from valuable experience.\\n\\nIn recent years, studies have shown that 66% of students who joined a club or have done an extracurricular have a higher chance of getting into colleges or getting a job. A lot of people can benefit from extra work experiences. Jobs and colleges are looking for talented individuals who know how to work. I think that is reason enough to start this program.\\n\\nThese activities give students who only want to socialize with people like them a place to meet others. Students with similar interests working together can be a force of good. When you get to learn and work beside those who you are comfortable with you'll do and feel much better. With everyone working together and no one is excluded everyone gets to help out and be apart of the group.\\n\\nGiving student a place where they can learn and develop talents and skills while also giving them work experience and, helping the meet new people is definitely a good idea. A school where students are able to express themselves in their own creative groups. That will not only give us great memories but, will also help us as adults. I think more schools should be open to opportunities\\xa0like this.\",\n",
       " 'Dear, State Senator\\n\\nI am in favor of keeping the Electoral college. i am in favor of keeping Electoral college because it was the original decision made by our founding fathers. the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.\\n\\nThe Electoral college consists of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to select the president. under the 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the District of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the elctoral college. for this reason, in the following discussion, the word \"state\" also refers to\\xa0 the District of columbia..\\n\\nmost states have a \"winner-takes-all\" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidates.\\n\\nbut people\\xa0 like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of commerce, and the AFL-CIO think that we should abolish the electoral college.\\n\\nalthough i am in favor of it, there are some disadvantages to electoral college. under the electoral college system, voters vote for a a slate of electors who in turn elect the president.\\n\\nthe american people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worst.

       " 'Making a decision is difficult. Whether it\\'s as big as buying a house, or as small as choosing an ice cream flavor, it\\'s hard. Even if you know what you want, how do you decide? While some people give it no thought at all, others do a lot of research. But there isn\\'t really a right or wrong way of doing it. At the end of the day, you\\'ll eventually come to a decision no matter how you got there. But there is one way that people find very helpful\\xa0when making a difficult choice. Asking others for their opinion. Some people might disagree, but this method is actually very helpful. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice, because it helps them become more open-minded and give them more options. While there are several other methods, this one has a couple of benefits.\\n\\nWhen you make a decision, sometimes you\\'ll just go with your gut. Let\\'s say you\\'re in line ordering ice cream. There are so many flavors to choose from, but your gut tells you to just go with vanilla. Because it\\'s the one flavor you have tried, you order vanilla. For some of us, this is the case. We go with our gut, because who knows yourself better than you? It\\'s okay to trust yourself, but sometimes you start to become closed-minded. This situation can completely change if you just ask a friend for their advice. Instead of ordering vanilla, you might get cookies and cream or rocky road. By hearing these other opinions, you become more open-minded. This will help you with decision making and other situations in life. The reason why seeking multiple opinions is helpful with decision making is, because it helps you become more open-minded.\\n\\nUsually when you have to make a choice, the few options make it hard to come to a decision. But asking people for their opinion make it easier to come to make a choice. It might not make sense that asking people for their opinion will magically create more options to choose from. That\\'s not what it does exactly, but it does give you more \"combinations\". Let\\'s say you were debating whether you should get a dog or not. You couldn\\'t decide, so you go to your friends for advice. One of them says that you should get a dog, because they\\'re very loyal. Another says you should get a dog, because they will keep you active. Another one says you should not get a dog, because they\\'re a lot to maintain. Now you have different \"combinations\". Two responses have the same answers but a different reason. This method helps you list the pros and cons for both choices so that you can make the best decision. Seeking multiple opinions is helpful when making a decision, because it gives you more options.\\n\\nTo some people, trusting their gut is the best way to make a decision. To others, it\\'s listing the pros and cons. But if you really think about it, asking people for advice is probably the best choice. The reason why it\\'s the best choice is, because you will be more open-minded and have more options when making a decision. Sometimes someone else\\'s opinion, whether you agree with it or not, helps you see more clearly. Life is full of decisions, and eventually, you won\\'t know what choice is better. Just ask a friend, review your options, and make a decision. Maybe you will regret your decision, but everything will work out in the end.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0',\n",

While taking these photos Viking 2 noticed a shadowly likness to a human face. There are some people think it was created by aliens, but research shows it looks like a landform.\\n\\nWhen scientist saw the picture they just assumed it was a rock clumb with the shadows causing it to look like an Egyption Pharaoh. When NASA unvieled the picture for the public to see they thought it would be a good idea to put, \"huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose, and mouth.\" They thought it would get more attention towards Mars, and it did. It became such a popular icon it appeared in films, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and check out lines at haunted grocery stores.\\n\\nConspiracy theorists say that scientist want to hide evidence that there is life on Mars. Other people say it was an ancient civilization on Mars. Even though only some scientist think its an alien artifact NASA made it their top prority. As they as they could they were going to gdet another photograph of the face. On April 5, 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia. Michael Malin and his team, MOC, took a picture ten times sharper than the first. The picture reavealed that there was no alien monument at all.\\n\\nMost people believed this, but not everyone. they figured the coordinents 41 degrees north martian latitude. In April of 1998 it was winter at the time, which is the time of year Mars becomes cloudy. This means the camera on board had to look through wispy clouds, which could hide some of the evidence. Finally on April 8, 2001 they got a clearer view for another picture. They find out that the picture is equivalent to a butte or messa.

       " '\"I believe that students would benefit from distance learning and attending classes from home. One reason for this is that it provides students with more flexibility to manage their time and responsibilities. For example, students who have part-time jobs or care for family members can attend class online at a time that works best for them. Additionally, students who are unable to attend school due to health concerns, transportation issues, or geographical barriers would have the opportunity to still participate in their coursework.\\n\\nMoreover, distance learning also allows teachers to tailor their teaching style to accommodate different learning styles. For instance, some students may learn better through visual aids or interactive activities, which can be easier to incorporate through online platforms. Distance learning also allows teachers to provide more one-on-one support and feedback to students.\\n\\nFurthermore, distance learning has been shown to improve student retention rates and academic performance, as students have more control over their own learning process. They can review lectures and materials at their own pace and have access to additional resources to help them further understand the content. \\n\\nIn conclusion, distance learning would offer an alternative to traditional classrooms by allowing students more flexibility, tailored learning styles, and a unique learning experience which would ultimately improve their academic performance.\"',\n",

True teenagers at times are irresponsible and they don't care about they're body and true they are lazy and don't right correct spelling and not only that but get distracted with they're phones and focus less on they're studies , but us as a nation we can do something about it or even change the education. TEACHER_NAME\\n\\nwhat i am trying to say is that we need to appreciate technology and true at times people are bad educated but we as a nation can collaborate together so that we could end this, please make the right decision by choosing policy 1.\\n\\nThank you,\\n\\nSincerely, STUDENT_NAME\",\n",
       " 'Distance learning isnÃ\\x82Â´t a very good program in my eyes. For instance, people will not be able to meet new friends, wifi errors could occur, and problem with the audio and video could occur as well. In some cases, having all of these happen to a person trying to get their education could potentially have them miss something important. People would want to do this program for great benefits, but unfortunately there are many risks of doing so.\\n\\nIf someone is doing long distance learning programs they wonÃ\\x82Â´t be socialized with other students. For some people they might find this relieving, but this could effect the way they react to the public. Normally when someone is used to being home all of the time and not going out causes them to want to stay home. If someone is home all of the time and they finally go to the public, theyÃ\\x82Â´re antisocial and awkward around other people. Students doing this program wouldnÃ\\x82Â´t be able to make new friends. These students would also have to learn to socialize with new people that they meet. In most peopleÃ\\x82Â´s lives it is important for them to meet new friends, go out, learn new things about the world. Having a teenager or young adult in this program could cause them to become a home body. They would always want to stay home, not talk to friends, canÃ\\x82Â´t meet new people, and they would just be antisocial all around.\\n\\nAnother example of why distance learning is a bad idea is that there is always a chance of error. For the video and audio calls it could potentially cut out for a moment, and the student could miss something very important that they need to know. For instance, if the class were going over directions of how to do a certain assignment while the video or audio cuts off, then the student doing long distance would have missed how to do it. ItÃ\\x82Â´s never good to miss something in class that you absolutely need to know. Even if the video goes out, the audio could still work. But if the audio goes out, then there is a very high risk of someone missing important instruction.\\n\\nThere are always errors to come with the internet. LetÃ\\x82Â´s say that class is in session and the student doing long distance has poor internet connection. The internet could fail for a few minutes if not longer, and while it is trying ti get fixed class is still going. This student could miss out on a very important assignment, or instructions they needed to know for a test, project, poster, etc. If that were to happen, the teacher most likely isnÃ\\x82Â´t going to stop for them to get reconnected. That means that the student would have to back track and ask the teacher what was missed while this error occurred.\\n\\nOn the other hand, this program could be beneficial to those students who are home bound. They would be in a comfortable place, get to see their friends, and also get their education. Unfortunately, there are so many things that could go wrong with this program. All of the reasons talked about above; are very likely to happen to someone doing long distance learning programs.\\n\\nSo in the end, it is best fir us to just do away with long distance learning programs. It would be best for all student education and for their sake of socializing. This program puts people at missing assignments, missing out on great people to meet, and more so missing out on life.',\n",
       " 'When it comes to life advice, it is always wise to get opinions from multiple people. Drawing from a variety of sources and perspectives provides a robust set of ideas to consider and helps to ensure that no stone is left unturned. As an example, if you’re trying to make the important decision of whether to go back to school and pursue a new degree, consulting with your family, mentors, or friends can be helpful in understanding different angles and potential outcomes. \\n\\nHaving multiple people weigh in on a decision can provide the support and confidence necessary to move forward; hearing different perspectives also reminds us to be flexible and to remain open to new possibilities, while keeping sight of our own personal values and goals. This is especially true in instances when a single opinion or valued opinion may not be sufficient. For example, if you are planning to make a career change you may need to talk to people who have successfully gone through the transition in order to recognize potential obstacles and create a realistic plan. \\n\\nGetting advice from multiple people allows us to benefit from everyone’s individual experiences, paving the way to a knighted path of informed decisions. All in all, leveraging feedback from multiple sources can be a rewarding and incredibly enriching venture on our life journeys.',\n",
       " \"Okay, here is my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:\\n\\nMaking a good first impression is super important. Like, really important. It can affect how people see you for the rest of your life. Think about it, when you meet someone new, you only have a few seconds to make them like you. If you come off as weird or boring, they might not want to be friends with you. But if you're funny or interesting, they'll probably want to hang out with you more.\\n\\nI know this from personal experience. In 6th grade, I met this kid named Max. He was really cool and funny, and we became fast friends. But then, one day, I accidentally knocked over his lunch tray in the cafeteria. It was a total mess, and I felt so embarrassed. Max was nice about it, but I could tell he thought I was kind of clumsy. After that, he didn't want to sit with me at lunch anymore. It was super sad.\\n\\nBut then, I started working on making a better first impression. I practiced being more careful and paying attention to my surroundings. And you know what? It worked! I made some new friends, and they all thought I was really cool.\\n\\nMaking a good first impression can also help you in other areas of your life. Like, if you're trying to get a job or get into a good college. Employers and admissions officers want to see that you're responsible and can make a good impression on people. They don't want to take a chance on someone who might be weird or unreliable.\\n\\nSo, in conclusion, making a good first impression is super important. It can affect how people see you for the rest of your life, and it can even help you in other areas of your life. So, be careful and try to make a good impression on everyone you meet!\",\n",
       " 'For many years people have been debating whether or not to keep the Electoral College or change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. According to source 1, the electoral college was established as \"a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.\" There are few positive effects of the Electoral College, however, there are many negative effects. I am in favor of changing the United States\\' election process to election by popular vote because there are many risks with the Electoral College, the Electoral College is outdated, and lastly, the Electoral College is unfair to voters in many states.\\n\\nCurrently, while using the Electoral College, the United States takes multiple risks. Some of the major risks were stated in source two. One of the major risks included, what of the elector put the vote in for the candidate he wished? Of course no matter what the situation, there will be risks to take. However, when those risks become actions, and happen more than once, people put up a guard and start to question whether or not the process is trustworthy. A sentence in source three declared, \"each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party\\'s nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. Americans are expected to trust a slate of electors whom we know little about personally, and trust is a personal thing. Trust is something that has to be earned. Therefore, when our trust is betrayed more than once because of the process the Electoral College, there is no way to earn that trust back once again. Without the Electoral College, this would not be an issue.\\n\\nNot only is the Electoral College risky, but it is also outdated. The Electoral College was created by the founding fathers, over a century ago. With new technology, and new systems forming, the election process should be more modern. Also, when it was decided to use the Electoral College, there were fewer people in the United States. Currently, in modern day, the population is much greater. A country with a greater population needs a modern election selection.\\n\\nThe Electoral College is very unfair to states that do not have the ability to make an impact in the election. If the election process were changed to elected by popular vote, smaller states would have the ability to make their vote matter.\\n\\nThe Electoral College needs to be changed immediately in able for citizens to stop worrying about taking major risks, so our country as more of a modern election process, and so every vote counts. Changing to election by popular vote could make the United States a better country.',\n",

Me and my family will sometimes go to Generic_City, or even just to the park. If I participated in school activities me and my family wouldn't be able to go places.

If I wasn't so shy I would participate in school activities. Due to being shy prevents me from making friends and when you make friends it can make the activity more funner than it already is. Shy can also be a good thing at times during schools activities because you won't be spotted out as much as the more talkative kids.

It's the nearest option for a planetary visit so why not. The author mentions in paragraph five that NASA has a idea for sending humans to study Venus in a safe way. Their idea was to have a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above to prevent being near the hot surface of Venus. At this height it will be survivable for humans. This sounds very workable. The only down side is that this makes it harder to study the planet and its surface. The author at the end of the article says that we should be able to travel to any place and should not be stopped or limited by any dangers and doubts.\\n\\nMany of the authors claims in the article were quite good and were quite reliable.

       " \"Graduating early from high school can lead to greater success in the long run. Research has shown that the benefits of graduating early include a greater likelihood of continuing a higher education, more time to explore interests and hobbies, and improved job prospects for the future. \\n\\nFor example, graduating from high school early is a surefire way to get a head start on your college career. With an extra year or two to spare, many early graduates go on to attend trade schools, universities, or pursue creative interests without the pressure of finishing a diploma. Furthermore, this extra time is beneficial in exploring internships and other professional opportunities that aren't available to traditional students.\\n\\nI can personally attest to these advantages, as I was able to use my extra time to gain experience in my field by training in a professional agency. Being able to land an internship soon after graduating early was difficult, but the time I had to prepare made it possible for me to stand out during the interviewing process. By putting myself in this position, I believe I had an edge alongside other graduating high school peers.\\n\\nOverall, graduating high school early can be a great way to increase success later on. Benefits such as more available time to pursue higher education and professional endeavors, give early graduates a great starting point.\",\n",
       " ' Being successful in life, everyone goes through setbacks, but having faith in oneself is the key. Everyone can learn from their mistakes, but those who stop and fail do not learn from them. The ones who fail and believe in themselves learn from their past mistakes and try again. By consistently practicing, a person can understand the subject or material they are trying to learn, which is how some people can achieve success. Those who do not practice will never get anywhere in life or reach their goals.\\n\\nWinston Churchill said, \"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.\" I agree with his statement. If you fail, for example, on a math test, you got an 53, but now, on the retake, you want to get an 80, that\\'s a goal you want to achieve. By practicing over time, people can learn from their mistakes and see how they develop over time. Those who become famous, millionaires, and company owners have had good and bad ideas, but they have learned from their mistakes and become successful. Winston Churchill is telling us that by failure and believing in ourselves, we can succeed.\\n\\nThere are many ways to achieve success, and the first step is to determine where and how to start a business or store. The second step is to determine how to acquire the money, resources, and a company to support it. While these two steps may seem challenging, the first step always starts small, using a room or making a stand out of wood if other options are not available. The second step involves buying the materials and resources needed to start the business, and if that does not work out, one can always use their own money to buy the rest.\\n\\nIn conclusion, success is not determined by how many times we fail, but by how we learn from our mistakes and continue to work towards our goals. It takes courage to believe in ourselves and to keep trying, even when we face setbacks. By consistently practicing, we can improve our skills and knowledge, which will help us achieve success in our personal and professional lives.',\n",

Like, they might have to take extra classes or get certain grades, but it\\'s totally worth it.  Because, think about it, you get to finish school earlier and have more time to do whatever you want!  Like, you could travel, or get a job, or just chill with your friends and enjoy your freedom. \\n\\nBut, you know, it\\'s not all rainbows and butterflies.  There are some things you gotta do in order to succeed.  First of all, you gotta be super motivated and focused.  Like, you can\\'t just slack off and expect to graduate early.  You gotta put in the work and make sure you\\'re getting good grades and stuff.  And you gotta talk to your guidance counselor and figure out what classes you need to take and stuff.  It\\'s not always easy, but it\\'s worth it in the end.\\n\\nSo, in conclusion, graduating early is a pretty cool opportunity, but you gotta be willing to put in the work.  It\\'s not always easy, but it\\'s definitely worth it.  And who knows, maybe one day you\\'ll be like, \"Hey, I graduated early and it was awesome!\"  And I\\'ll be like, \"Wow, cool!  Good job!\" \\n\\nAnyway, that\\'s my essay.  I hope you guys found',\n",
       " \"Dear Principal,\\n\\nI think students should not take position in community service. My reason of this opinion is because not all students have time for community service hours. Some might do sports or any other after school activities. Some students also have commitments at home, jobs, etc. I think community service should only be for those who have made negative decisions in or out of school.\\n\\nFor example, if a student decides to skip school for a whole day without their parents or the school knowing that he/she is not in school then he/she should take position in community service for making a bad choice. Now if someone just chews gum in class or eats something when they are not suppose to they should just be punished such as detention or staying at school after classes are over. If a student gets in trouble out of school, such as with the police, the should take position in community service. I think that if a student is required to do community service but they are not in trouble, then they should do something simple such as reading to those who are blind or do after school tutoring if they have time. If you are doing community service because you have gotten in trouble at school or with the police then you should do something more of a punishment.\\n\\nSuch as cleaning a school or shoveling people's driveways during the winter time. They can also repaint or wash buildings. These are just a few examples of hard community service. This is my reasoning of students not taking position in community service.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME\",\n",
       " 'Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can greatly benefit society. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can combat the issue of greenhouse gas emissions, create more compact and accessible communities, and improve the overall quality of life.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact it can have on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for a significant proportion of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By limiting the number of cars on the roads, we can effectively decrease these emissions and mitigate the detrimental effects of climate change. This is especially important considering the increasing number of private cars owned by the middle class in developing countries, which are contributing to the pollution of cities.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more compact and accessible communities. The passages explain how new approaches to suburban planning, such as in the German suburb of Vauban, involve placing stores within walking distance rather than on distant highways. This not only encourages residents to rely less on cars, but also promotes healthier and more sustainable living. Additionally, these developments often prioritize public transportation and have limited parking spaces, making it more convenient for people to use alternative modes of transportation.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in the overall quality of life for individuals. The passage describes how residents of Vauban, Germany, who have given up their cars, report feeling happier and less stressed. This is because relying on cars can be a source of tension and anxiety, whereas other modes of transportation, such as biking or walking, can be more enjoyable and relaxing. Additionally, reducing car usage can lead to less congestion on roads, resulting in faster and more efficient travel for everyone.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage can have significant advantages for society. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, create more compact and accessible communities, and improve the overall well-being of individuals. By implementing smart planning strategies, such as those seen in Vauban, Germany, and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can work towards a future with less reliance on cars and a more sustainable and livable environment.',\n",

This would also be good because it would cause people to use less fuel.\\n\\nThis would help people that are not very good with directions to find what they are looking for. If it was a computer driving the car it would have a lot less mistakes while driving. If we were to put sensers around the car it would activeate the brakes on individual wheels if nessacery.

       " 'Imagine living in a world where everybody thinks alike. A place where everybody has the same political views, the same views on relationships and even ice cream\\xa0flavor.\\n\\nA world that lacks different kinds of people with different mindsets is no world at all. Without unique mindsets to guide you through the highs, lows and small mysteries of life, we would all be at a roadblock. Weather you seek advice from outsiders often or do so once every blue moon, every person you ask will answer your question differently, with a unique thought process of their own. Seeking multiple opinions can guide someone to make a better choice in various ways, such as opening their eyes to something they hadn\\'t previously thought about, and having them realize what someone else would do if they were in that same position, taking multiple opinions into consideration is beneficial to all of us.\\n\\nAsking others simply for their input on a subject can deeply affect the way that you may view something. Outsiders viewpoints on a subject can change our perspectives drastically, opening our eyes to a new and different way of thinking. Every single one of us has had something in our past that affects our decision making process, weather its based on our experiences or how we were raised. It may be that you think through things with more caution, or don\\'t think through things at all and thats why you are so spontaneous. I once asked a friend if I should get a necklace with pearls on it or a necklace with golden stars on it. She told me the one with stars on it because she enjoyed the way it looked on me. I then turned to my other friend who was known for thinking through things with a bit more caution and logical thinking. She started to ask me questions, \"What necklace would you get more use out of?\" \"Which necklace could you wear in all of the seasons?\" \"What necklace is the most similar to a necklace that you already have?\" With her advice I then realized that I owned necklaces that were similar to the stars at home and I would get much more use out of the pearls because they went with all of my outfits and were always classy. I would have had a necklace with golden stars on it, that I may have not gotten much use out of. However, with the input of another outside source I was able to eliminate that situation from happening. Though this is an example on a small scale with little actual effect or strong importance, the same thought process applies\\xa0to something on a larger scale. With more viewpoints and opinions comes the idea of higher knowledge and with knowledge comes more implied power.\\n\\nRealizing that everybody has unique and different viewpoints can be extremley beneficial to all of us. When we take advantage of many unique view points it helps us to make a better choice. Hearing the thoughts and opinions of others opens our eyes to ideas that we may not have previously taken into consideration, the viewpoints of others may even make us realize what someone else would do if they were in our position. Everybody has a past that affects and alters the way that they make everyday decisions or life changing decisions. However, with the help of multiple people\\'s opinions, it can lead us down the pathway of a better decision. Next time you need help with picking the better choice, seek multiple people with different view points to really find the true right choice.',\n",

       " \"I agree with policy 1, but not without certain rules. Cell phones are used in almost everyone's daily life. It makes people feel safer when they can pull a phone from their pocket and call for help. Unfortunately, in today's society they are used for more then needed. I think it would be all right to allow children to use cell phones during breaks and lunch, but in classrooms the rules would have higher punishment. For example, making the cost higher to get it back or longer detention. That would be more suitable.\\n\\nWhen people are stopped from doing something completely they will most likely do it more. In my personal experience, about six months ago I went to a school that had such tight policies about cell phones, if phones were even seen in your pocket they would be taken up. Therefore the children used them all the time, in class, lunch, anywhere and anyway they could.\\n\\nNow, when I go this school, children are allowed to carry cell phones around and I see them being used so much less, the teachers aren't always talking about how the phones are never allowed, they make it easier on everyone. Seen and not heard.\\n\\nOf course, in extreme cases, policy 2 would be better, it depends solely on what kind of environment your in. Although in my school I see no good reason why not to allow cell phone usage on breaks, I think it would create a less stressful place. Teachers could even send notifications to the students, if that could be allowed, about homework updates or due dates. Besides cell phone are probably one of the most used, most owned devices in America, why not use them to help us with school and not get us in trouble.      \",\n",

I practiced for hours every day, my fingers sore and my mind focused on the chords and strumming patterns. It wasn't easy, but with persistence and dedication, I finally got it! It was an incredible feeling, knowing that I had accomplished something I never thought I could do.\\n\\nMastering something can be a game-changer. It boosts your confidence and makes you feel more capable of tackling new challenges. When I started learning how to play the guitar, I thought it was just a fun hobby, but it actually helped me in other areas of my life. For instance, it taught me the importance of perseverance and hard work, which I can apply to my schoolwork and other areas of my life.\\n\\nBut here's the thing – once you've mastered something, it's easy to get complacent and stop learning. I mean, I already know how to play the guitar, so why bother practicing anymore? But that's not the way to go. Continuous learning and growth are crucial for personal and professional development.\\n\\nOne way to continue learning is by exploring new areas of interest. For example, I've always been interested in music production, so I started learning how to use music software and producing my own beats. It's been a fun and rewarding experience, and it's helped me see the music-making process from a different perspective.\\n\\nAnother way to continue learning is by seeking out new challenges. For instance, I've started playing in a band with some friends, and it's pushed me to improve my skills and learn new techniques. It's also helped me develop my sense of rhythm and timing, which is essential for playing with a group.\\n\\nI've also seen many examples of people who continue to learn and grow even after they've mastered something. For instance, professional athletes often work with coaches and trainers to improve their skills and stay ahead of the competition. Similarly, successful businesspeople are always looking for new ways to innovate and stay ahead of the curve.\\n\\nIn conclusion, mastering something can be a powerful tool for personal\",\n",

In this essay, I will explore the positive effects of technology on people's lives in economic, educational, and familial aspects.\\n\\nFirstly, technology has had a positive impact on the economy. It has created new job opportunities and increased productivity in existing industries. For example, the rise of e-commerce has created new jobs in the retail industry, such as online salespeople and logistics workers. Additionally, technology has increased efficiency in manufacturing and production, leading to lower costs and higher profits. This has led to the creation of more jobs and increased economic growth.\\n\\nSecondly, technology has had a positive impact on education. It has made education more accessible and efficient. For example, online courses and educational apps have made it possible for people to learn from anywhere in the world. This has made education more affordable and accessible, especially for people who live in remote areas or who cannot afford to attend traditional schools. Additionally, technology has made it easier for teachers to deliver content and for students to access resources. This has led to improved learning outcomes and a more efficient education system.\\n\\nFinally, technology has had a positive impact on families. It has made it easier for families to stay connected and communicate with each other. For example, social media platforms and messaging apps have made it possible for people to stay in touch with family and friends no matter where they are in the world. Additionally, technology has made it easier for families to manage their daily lives. For example, smart home devices and apps have made it possible for families to control their home's temperature, lighting, and security from their phones. This has led to increased convenience and improved family dynamics.\\n\\nIn conclusion, technology has had a significant impact on people's lives in economic, educational, and familial aspects. It has created new job opportunities, increased productivity, made education more accessible, and improved family dynamics.

       " \"Online schooling and virtual classes have become very popular in recent years. More and more schools have offered these online classes as a way for students who can't come into an actual class to get an education. There are many schools all over the United States that offer this program and it would not be suprising if more schools start to offer online education. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it allows students who are sick to get an education, it allows students who have a disability to get an education, and it allows students who are being bullied at school to get an education.\\n\\nFirst off, some students can get sick for a very long time or even a short amount time. Either way, students will be missing school and be missing out an getting an education. Whether that is just the common cold, or the flu, the student will most likely not go to school because they do not want to get their peers sick. Especially with the flu that has spread all over America, and the Coronavirus that has spread all over the world, students will not be able to go to school if ill or contaminated. Students who have the oppurtunity to get an online education, will not be effected by an illness and still get the education they deserve.\\n\\nNext, students who have a disability, mentally or physically, will still be able to get an education with online classes. There are many people in the world who are mentally or physically disabled, who are not getting the education they deserve because they cannot go to school. The medium to small population of disabled people in the United States will be able to learn new things and new ideas just from the implementation of online classes. The physically disabled may not have the means or ability to get to an actual classroom but with virtual classes, the physically disabled will have an oppurtunity to get the same education as the rest of the population. Virtual classes would benefit the disabled incredibly.\\n\\nFinally, students who are being bullied in school will be able to get an education without being tormented or harrassed. Bullying is an awful epidemic that has only got worse with the introduction of cyberbullying but it has always been terrible in school. A large amount of the population of students in school are bullied and as awful as that is, it is only getting worse. Schools are not doing much about bullying because either the student's don't report it, or the school doesn't do anything about it. With the oppurtunity of online classes and virtual learning, the students who are bullied will be able to get an education in a safe, and comfortable enviorment. Students who are being bullied would love this idea as it allows them to get an education without any terrible distractions.\\n\\nOne may argue that online education limits human to human interaction and will cause the students to be antisocial. However, students in these circumstances will be able to get an education in which everyone deserves, and be able to go to school sponsored social events and do other social things, just not inside a school.

With a four-day work week, students can have more time to focus on their studies and prepare for exams, which can lead to better academic performance. Additionally, students can use this extra time to pursue hobbies and interests that they may not have time for during a traditional five-day work week.\\n\\nSecondly, teachers also need more free time in their lives. Teaching can be a very demanding profession, and teachers often have to spend a lot of time outside of school helping students with homework and tutoring. With a four-day work week, teachers can have more time to spend with their families, pursue hobbies and interests, and take care of their own mental health. This can lead to a happier and more fulfilled teaching experience.\\n\\nFurthermore, a four-day work week with ten-hour days can also have positive effects on the economy. With fewer work days, employees can have more time to spend money on goods and services, which can boost the economy. Additionally, a four-day work week can lead to increased productivity and job satisfaction, which can lead to lower turnover rates and higher employee morale.\\n\\nHowever, it is important to note that a four-day work week with ten-hour days may not be suitable for all industries or companies. Some industries may require employees to work longer hours or be available for emergency situations, and companies may not be able to afford to pay their employees for a four-day work week. It is important for policymakers and employers to carefully consider the benefits and drawbacks of a four-day work week before implementing it.\\n\\nIn conclusion, a four-day work week with ten-hour days has numerous benefits for both students and teachers. It can lead to improved academic performance, increased job satisfaction, and a happier and more fulfilled teaching experience. While it may not be suitable for all industries or companies, it is worth considering as a potential solution to the challenges faced by modern workers.',\n",
       " \"Dear Principal,\\n\\nI think the policy in which cell phones are allowed during free time is better than no cell phones at all. Even if you banned cell phones it wouldn't stop kids from bringing them to school. Kids like to keep in touch, which is why they have cell phones. Since they can't talk in class texting is more sneaky than writhing paper notes and throwing them around the classroom where the teachers are watching.\\n\\nIts also a good time to call parents in free time if they are staying after school of they are riding home with a friend's parent. It feels less tense than asking a teacher to use your cell phone or using the school's phone. If kids are allowed to have their cell phones during free time there may be a chance they won't use their cell phone in class in return. Besides, if they aren't allowed to use their cell phones in school there is a chance they would use it in class and look cool doing it. It would just get other people trying to do it too. And if you are going to let cell phones in school, you have to enforce the rules better than with the 'no cell phones' rule. Give a big consequence if they decide to go against the rules, Like a lunch or an after school detention. Or maybe get their cell phone taken away and they can only get it back after class or school. Also you could probably send it to you, the principal's office where the can get it after school or by rules have a parent pick up the phone. If you enforce this rule you could make all the students sign a contract that they will only use their cell phones during lunch or free time or else they may have to face consequences such as the ones mentioned before. Tell them that this is not a freedom but a privilege.\\n\\nI think you should allow cell phones to be in school but just at lunch or a free time. That way everyone gets what they want. Kids actually get the opportunity to actually use cell phones at school. If kids get more freedom, so do you. I think you will be very surprised how many students will agree and respect this rule. Kids want to use their cell phones so I'm pretty sure no one will be breaking this policy. You, the principal can be rest assured that kids are using their cell phones at a free time but not in class. And if there were anything to happen with this rule you can always have the right to remove this rule and ban cell phones in school once and for all.\\n\\nThank you,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME\",\n",
       " 'Summer projects are a means by which schools are able to ensure that students are, in some way, continuing to persue an apprehension of knowledge and a greater understanding over the course of the summer. Schols assign students summer work to not only ensure that they continue to lern but to prepare them for the next step in their academic carrer. It is in the students best interest for their summer project to be designed by their teacher, wno inherintley has more knowledge and experience in diserning what is best for the them in their persuit of higher knowledge. Although many individuals believe that student designed summer projects are more beneficial to the development of a childs path towards gaining knowledge, teacher designed summer projects better surve in the childs best interest because teachers have the ability to tailor various summer projects in away that will prepare students for the next step in their academic career and, because of the inherent lazines of most students.\\n\\nTeacher designed projects are more beneificial to a childs academic development because they have the ability to tailor projects in a way that will prepare students for the next step in their academic career. Teachers posses the unique ability and experience that provides them with the ability to introduce concepts to students through summer projects that they will need to be familiar with for their future classes. For example, in the summer prior to my sophmore year I was told to write a research paper on John Locke. This research paper introduced me to a person I had never heard of before which inturn better prepred me for my Humane letters class which discussed a variety of his ideas.\\n\\nWithout this teacher assigned project, I would have never received any form of introduction to this vital aspect of my class. Teachers also have the ability and knowledge to reintroduce both review and preequasite work that many students neglect to remeber as they enter in the next stage of their academic development. Before entering honors calculus, my algebra II/Trig teacher provided us with a packet that included all o the prerequasite concepts we would need to be familiar with to be successful in the class. I had forgotten many of the concepts that would be neccesary to pass the class, but, with the help of my teacher, over the summer I was able to become prepared which enabled me to be sccessful in the class. Through prepration, the learning process becaomes much less daunting and much more managable.\\n\\nTeacher desinged summer projects are more benificial to a student learning because students are inherently lazy. Many students fail to realize the value of knowledge and instead, only seek short term staisfaction. Many students would rather watch tv then attempt to learn something new. Thus, many students when given the oppurtunity to desighn their own summer projects, will pick something that is inherently simplicitic and quick to complete. Often, what students fail to realize is that when something is inherently simplistic and easy to complete their is often litte to be gained from its complesion. Many students, myself included, often spend hours a day on social media looking at images or videos which are inherintly meaningless. Rather than reading a book or learning something new, we indulge ourselves, and seek out short term satisfaction. However, when a student is assigned a summer project designed by a teacher, they are forced to work hard to complete an assignment which is often desighned to challenge them. As an artist, when I am given specific peramideters and deadlness concerning a new project I am much more modivated to complete my work in a timely manner. This greatly parallels my behavior concerning my self assigned work which I often put off completing. Teacher designed projects force us to push past our limits which inturn forces us to think in creative ways ad learn something new. Teacher designed projects motivate students to achieve a greater undestanding.\\n\\nAlthough many individuals believe that compared to teacher designed work, student designed work allows students to have more freedom regarding their own learning and eduation, this is untrue. Student designed projects only give student freedom to learn about certain subjects to a point. Students are limited by their resources and overall, often only attempt to learn about something through the means of the internet. Teachers however, have sent years studying the subjects within their perspective feilds and often have decades of experience and resources at their disposal. Students simply lack the means to be able to guide their own education and acquisition of konwledge. Teachers on the other hand, can provide support and resources when designing various projects that a student wouldnt have acess to\\n\\nOverall teacher designed summer projects are more beneficial to a students growth and devlopment over the course of the summer.

In this essay, I will analyze the positive effects of technology on individuals' lives and provide real-life examples to support my analysis.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most significant benefits of technology is the ability to find new jobs. With the rise of the internet and social media, job opportunities are now more accessible than ever before. For example, job search websites like LinkedIn and Indeed allow individuals to search for job openings in their field and location, making it easier to find work. Additionally, technology has enabled the creation of new jobs that were not possible before. For instance, social media managers, app developers, and data analysts are all jobs that have emerged due to the rise of technology.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother positive effect of technology is the ability to meet new people. Social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram have made it easier for individuals to connect with others from all over the world. This has led to the formation of online communities and the ability to meet people with similar interests. Additionally, technology has enabled the creation of new forms of communication, such as video conferencing and instant messaging, which has made it easier for individuals to communicate with others, even if they are not in the same location.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, technology has had a significant impact on the way individuals communicate with others. With the rise of social media and instant messaging, individuals can now communicate with others in real-time, regardless of their location.

Additionally, technology has enabled the creation of new forms of communication, such as virtual reality and augmented reality, which have the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with others.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, technology has had a positive impact on individuals' lives, particularly in terms of finding new jobs, meeting new people, and communicating with others. Real-life examples, such as job search websites and social media platforms, demonstrate the benefits of technology in these areas. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see even more positive effects on individuals' lives.\",\n",

The program would be a success because student helping one another is great seeing them work together as a class having a good time with there class mates. Also the older student are more responsible there also likely to be more trust worthy. They would help the younger student a lot i feel like they would learn more.\\n\\nThen in a few years later the younger student would come the older student and from there they help them as well too. This program would be a great one it would there student a lot. I also think they would be focus all the time. I would also like to be in this program it seems like you would know so many things. I really think this program would be successful to all the student.',\n",
       " ' Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, \"Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.\"\\n\\nI agree with Emerson\\'s statement because trying new things is essential for growth. While it\\'s important to be proficient in what you already know, it\\'s also important to challenge yourself and push your limits.\\n\\nAdditionally, we learn more about ourselves and the world around us when we try new things. When we step outside of our comfort zone, we discover new skills, perspectives, and experiences that we may not have had otherwise.\\n\\nFurthermore, trying new things can also lead to greater satisfaction and fulfillment in life. When we achieve something new or overcome a challenge, we feel a sense of accomplishment and pride that can boost our self-esteem and motivation.\\n\\nIn my experience, I have found that trying new things has been a key factor in my personal and professional growth. Whether it\\'s learning a new language, taking up a new hobby, or pursuing a new career path, pushing myself to try new things has helped me to become a more well-rounded and confident individual.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while it\\'s important to be proficient in what you already know, it\\'s also important to challenge yourself and try new things. By doing so, we can grow, learn, and achieve greater satisfaction and fulfillment in life.',\n",
       " 'As an eighth-grade student, joining extracurricular activities is a crucial decision that can have a significant impact on our academic and personal growth. While some people believe that students should be given the freedom to make this decision for themselves, others argue that it should be left to the schools to decide. In this essay, I will explore the pros and cons of leaving the decision of joining extracurricular activities up to students.\\n\\nOn the one hand, allowing students to make their own decisions about joining extracurricular activities can have many benefits. For one, students are more likely to be invested in the activities they choose to participate in, which can lead to greater engagement and a deeper sense of fulfillment. Additionally, students who are given the freedom to choose their own activities are more likely to find activities that align with their interests and passions, which can lead to a more enjoyable and meaningful experience.\\n\\nOn the other hand, leaving the decision of joining extracurricular activities up to students can also have some drawbacks. For one, some students may not have the necessary information or guidance to make an informed decision about which activities to join. This can lead to students missing out on opportunities to participate in activities that may be beneficial to their academic and personal development. Additionally, some students may be pressured into joining activities that they are not truly interested in, which can lead to a negative experience and a waste of time.\\n\\nIn conclusion, leaving the decision of joining extracurricular activities up to students has both pros and cons. While it can lead to greater engagement and a more enjoyable experience, it can also lead to a lack of guidance and pressure to join activities that may not be beneficial. Ultimately, it is important for schools to provide students with the necessary information and guidance to make informed decisions about joining extracurricular activities, while also respecting their autonomy and allowing them to choose activities that align with their interests and passions.',\n",
       " \"Driverless cars are a bad idea for a couple of reasons. People may begin to become naive while driving, start being a victim in more wrecks, and be in danger of losing safety. Do we really want to put people's lives in danger just so we don't have to drive and can be lazy?\\n\\nThe first reason is that people may become naive and try to sleep while driving because they will believe you do not have to drive at all. This is wrong because in the passage it states that you do have to drive whenever the car needs human help and can not complete a certain action such as driving through roadwork zone or accidents. The name of the car is a false advertisement if you don't read into it.\\n\\nAnother reason is if a person gets in a wreck while in this car would it be considerd the person's fault or the manufacturers? If the person is not driving then it would be the manufacturers for a malfunction in the car. This will put these manufacturers at a place where they will have to pay for damage and insurance to whoever was wrecked into and fix the problem. If this happens to more than one person people may not buy the car or from the company of the car anymore. As stated in the passage there are no rules currently about these driveless cars and there would have to be a new set of rules that would need to be made. Many states are forbidding them completeley and you can't even test drive computer driven cars.\\n\\nMy last reason is that these cars are not completely safe. In paragraph eight it states that drivers may get bored waiting on their turn to drive. This could result in people falling asleep and playing on their phones when they should, at all times, keep their eyes on the road. Anything could happen at any time and it could be unexpected. The cars do not seem incredibly safe for anybody to drive.\\n\\nI would not reccomend this car for anybody. However if you are older and wiser and know what you are doing this could be the car for you. You will just need to be so much more aware of your surroundings and make sure that you are always paying attention. These cars require a lot more responsiblity than a normal car would. So when looking to buy a driverless car consider all of these points. And in the end, is it really worth it?\",\n",
       " \"As an eighth-grade student, I have experienced the impact of praise on my self-esteem, as well as the motivations and effects of achieving goals without any praise. In this essay, I will explore these topics and provide my perspective on the importance of praise and goal-setting in shaping a student's self-esteem.\\n\\nPraise is a powerful tool that can boost a student's self-esteem and motivation. When students receive praise for their accomplishments, they feel valued and recognized for their hard work. This can increase their confidence and self-worth, leading to a more positive attitude towards learning and achieving goals. For example, when I received a compliment on my writing skills, I felt proud of myself and more motivated to continue writing.\\n\\nHowever, not all praise is created equal. When praise is given insincerely or without effort, it can be demotivating and even harmful to a student's self-esteem. In such cases, students may feel like they are not being taken seriously or that their accomplishments are not worth recognition. On the other hand, when praise is given in a genuine and meaningful way, it can have a positive impact on a student's self-esteem and motivation.\\n\\nAchieving goals without any praise can also have its motivations and effects on a student's self-esteem. When students set and achieve goals without any recognition or praise, they may feel a sense of accomplishment and pride in themselves. This can increase their self-esteem and confidence, leading to a more positive attitude towards learning and achieving goals. For example, when I set and achieved a goal to read a certain number of books, I felt proud of myself and more motivated to continue reading.\\n\\nHowever, achieving goals without any praise can also have its drawbacks. When students do not receive any recognition or praise for their accomplishments, they may feel unimportant or unvalued. This can decrease their self-esteem and confidence, leading to a more negative attitude towards learning and achieving goals. For example, when I set and achieved a goal to complete a math problem, but did not receive any recognition for it, I felt like my accomplishment was not worth anything.\\n\\nIn conclusion, praise and goal-setting are important tools in shaping a student's self-esteem. When praise is given in a genuine and meaningful way,\",\n",
       " \"Have you ever asked someone for some advice, and they give you a stupid answer, so you then ask other people and feel a lot better about your situation. That is because asking multiple people actually helps people make a better choice. So that in the end, they know that they made the best choice. This is because multiple people can give you more reasons towards\\xa0the same solution, and a lot of different ideas. Going to multiple people to help with your situation can give you more ideas for answers to your problems, make them feel better about the decision they made, and help you feel less isolated with your problem.\\n\\nFirst, seeking more than one person can give you many ideas as answers to your problem. Just asking one person may give you multiple ideas, that you think are enough, but it is more helpful to ask a variety of people, to see different views from different people. Gathering multiple solutions is the key to making good decisions, because you have heard a variety of different options, and decided the most reasonable one. In fact, in many scenarios, you could use many ideas, to form new ideas that will work out even better. Because of this, many ideas is most definitely a good thing to have, and should be used for every situation.\\n\\nNext, having many solutions will help make you feel better about your decision.\\n\\nIf you ask somebody, and you use their answer, then you are actually more likely to regret it in the future, as apposed to asking multiple people, and picking a reasonable answer that ten other people recommended. You have multiple people backing your decision up, and you are not in the fight alone. This will boost your confidence in your decision, leaving your regrets to a minimum. If you ask one man, and you use his answer, you have nobody besides that man to help you. That is one of the many reasons why asking multiple people is essential.\\n\\nFinally, going to more than one person helps you actually feel less isolated. Sure many people do it for ideas, but majority of times, they just don't want to feel alone. You need a lot of support for the tough decisions, which is one thing that you can't keep hidden. People need to talk to other people about their problems, and that is what they are doing when they ask you for advice. So, you might actually start talking to the people you talked to about it, which will help them help you get through your situation together.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Getting many ideas, feeling better about your decision, and feeling less isolated are all reasons that people talk to more than one person for advice. Some parts, they do to help with their situation, others they just want a friend. Either way, they do it to make a better choice for the problem, or themselves. So, talking to other people is almost always the way to handle your problem, and it helps you, so why not do it. Just talk to someone if you are dealing with a situation, and need some advice. Afterall, they may be dealing with a similair situation too.\",\n",

One time he was taking a really hard test like this one, but he didn\\'t know that it was going to decide if he is going to attend college or not, so he just sat down on the chair in Generic_School Library and he began to take the test, he had to take another year of high school, but he figured that he doesn\\'t want to fail this senior year.\\n\\nIf he fails again he has to graduate with a bunch of kids, that doesn\\'t sound right, does it? i\\'m from a family that always want their kids to be a doctor or an engineer, and they want to show to other parents that \"my child is better than yours\". So they kept putting pressure on me for months and years but it didn\\'t seem to help a lot, but I had to make a change one day not because I was trying to make my parents happy or impress the other parents, but I was tired, I was tried of not having respect in the family, like anything that i said didn\\'t mean anything to them, so I had to change, and with that change came a lot of consequences, for example losing my friends, not leaving the house as much as I used to, working less so it means less money on my paycheck by the end or every two weeks, but i didn\\'t care as much, because I knew that this is going to be my last year at Generic_School.\\n\\nI will learn from my defeats, and make sure that they wouldn\\'t happen again, like one time I was working at Panera, my main job, and it was still my training week so I had no clue what the names for the dressing and the food was, so there is this computer above every line that tells you what the name of the food is, and it tells you all of the ingredients in the food and what kind of dressing that salad or what kind of sauce that food needs, so I followed the ingredients on the computer but i had made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich before the order i was making, and the costumer was allergic to peanut butter but i didn\\'t know that so i made their salad with the gloves that was contacted with the peanut, so I gave the salad to my friend to bag it and he asked me \"Hey Generic_Name! did u make sure to change your gloved after each order?\" and I said \"I\\'m sorry, I didn\\'t know that i have to change my gloves every time.\" he said \"It\\'s fine, just change your gloves and make another salad.\" after that i have always changed my gloves after every order.\\n\\nBy the way my side job is detailing cars at all in one auto group located in Generic_City, VA. It\\'s not a really easy job, but the pay is good, $50/hour, for a teenager that\\'s a really good amount of money and imagine me working every day for a year and working 5 hours every day, yea, that is a lot of money for someone like me, last year i bought a lot of stuff with the money i made, I bought a car, a new phone, a really expensive watch, and a bunch of other stuff that u get when u have a lot of money, they don\\'t affect your life, but they are just there, for entertainment purposes, like who really needs to have a Nintendo switch and a ps4 at the same time, like what type normal person would do that, you only do this type of stuff when you have too much money, and having too much money and not knowing what to do with it is insane.\\n\\nMe failing makes me stronger, it\\'s like you are running a marathon but every time you fall u get faster and faster, you keep getting closer to the finish line, and that is a good thing, the finish line is where we all are going to end up, but it depends what u do during this race that decides if you are going to win or not, if you keep failing and failing and not learning from it then I feel bad for you, but you have to focus and learn and decide what is good and what is not good for you, you should not be distracted by the stuff around you and your life. humans are stronger that what they think, i read somewhere that humans only use %1 of their brain capacity, imagine the day that we all would use at least %50 of it.\\n\\nIf you ever feel like u have be defeated in life, you are not correct, get back on your feet and started working hard again, there no way that you would do something the right way and not get a good result out of it, it\\'s impossible to do so, unless you are pretending that you are doing it, in fact that used to be me last year, pretending like i\\'m doing homework, pretending like i\\'m listening to the teacher, but where did i go with all of that, just because I was lazy and didn\\'t want to pay attention, I lost the race, but I got back on my feet this year, and i\\'m making sure that i\\'m happy, more than anyone else, I\\'m not going to let any negativity impact my life.\\n\\nMy dad used to tell me, he still does, but he says that \"imagine you are a racing horse and you have covers on your eyes, so you would only see in front of you\", apparently it makes the horse focus on the race but he said that \"you have a lot of distractions on your way but focus on what you have to do and only that, nothing else. just keep running and don\\'t let the distractions affect your life, if they do you will lose balance and either affect someone else or you are the only one that will fall over, and that is not a good thing.\"\\n\\nIn general just focus on your life have fun at times but make sure it doesn\\'t affect anything and if it does, make sure that you, with the help of someone else or by yourself can figure out a way to resolve the situation, sometimes it\\'s a really good option to get help from the people that you know, like for example friends and family or even the school counselor or the principal, just get some help if you think that you can\\'t resolve it by yourself. so the former British prime minister called \"Winston Churchill\" is right about \"success consists of going from failure without loss of enthusiasm.\" I agree with his opinoin.',\n",

I disagree with that because, most students in our school have a grade C average.

Most students that do well academically, most of the time aren't good in sports because, they may not have time to practice their sports. Also, most students that are poor in academics, they are good in sports because they have the time to practice, get outside, be active and exercise more too. So for the students are good in sports but poor in academics you should keep it to a grade C average, because kids need a an outlet to go to, have fun and get their mind off of things.

       " \"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nCar usage has become an integral part of suburban life in many societies. However, there is a growing trend to limit car usage in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the overall quality of life. This essay will explore the advantages of limiting car usage, as demonstrated in various examples from around the world. By adopting smart planning, promoting alternative transportation, and creating car-free spaces, societies can achieve a multitude of benefits, including reduced emissions, increased accessibility, and improved physical and mental well-being.\\n\\nBody:\\n\\nParagraph 1:\\n\\nLimiting car usage can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. For instance, in Vauban, Germany, an experimental car-free community, 70% of families do not own cars, and 57% of residents sold a car to move there. As a result, Vauban's residents experience reduced carbon emissions, with cars being responsible for only 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. This example highlights the potential impact of limiting car usage on reducing environmental harm.\\n\\nParagraph 2:\\n\\nBeyond environmental advantages, limiting car usage can improve accessibility to services and amenities. Smart planning, which focuses on compact communities with accessible public transportation, makes daily tasks more convenient. Instead of relying on cars, stores are located within walking distance on main streets, reducing the need for long-distance travel. This approach has been adopted in many places, including suburbs in the United States. By making suburbs more compact and accessible, the dependency on cars decreases, improving the overall quality of life for residents.\\n\\nParagraph 3:\\n\\nAdditionally, limiting car usage can have a positive impact on physical and mental well-being. Car-free communities, such as Vauban, create environments conducive to walking, cycling, and other physical activities. These means of transportation not only contribute to a healthier lifestyle but also reduce air pollution and noise pollution. Studies have shown that increased physical activity and reduced exposure to pollutants have significant health benefits, resulting in lower rates of obesity, respiratory diseases, and stress-related disorders.\\n\\nParagraph 4:\\n\\nThe success of limiting car usage is not limited to specific regions. Examples from around the world demonstrate the potential for positive change. For instance, a car-free day was implemented in Bogota, Colombia, to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The event introduced millions of Colombians to alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and taking public buses. The overwhelming participation in the event highlights the willingness of people to embrace change and prioritize sustainability.\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nLimiting car usage brings numerous advantages to individuals, communities, and the environment. By adopting smart planning, promoting alternative transportation, and creating car-free spaces, societies can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve accessibility, and enhance physical and mental well-being. The examples mentioned in this essay demonstrate the success and potential of limiting car usage, urging societies to reconsider their dependence on cars and embrace a more sustainable and healthier lifestyle. It is essential for citizens and policymakers to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and work towards making our communities more sustainable and livable for future generations.\",\n",

It should be cancelled, and be based upon popular vote with numbers that make since. Many votes have been barely won because the numbers are so close and high.

They didnt even get Ads that could give them at least a look or a hint, basically, the people were clueless. It even seems a little unorganized, the Electoral College dosent make much since either based on the information given, but what you should really think about is how the Electoral College has hint of trying to cheat its way into electing a canidate.\\n\\nIn addition, The voters are left with an unfair outcome at almost every election because of the Electoral Collage. The votes can either be very close or the people could miss Ads or campaigns for canidates, leaving the people with nothing and confusion all over. Even if you knew what elector you voted for, you cant necessarily pick who it is your voting for and your vote could possibly get confued giving you a bad outcome. Most elections are just slid by and are just based on what ever the Electoral College thinks should happen.

If they pick up litter they can promote others to help clean parks lakes and make a healthier environment for everyone.\\n\\nSome of the community services can give people experience so when they get older getting a job can be easier.

       " 'People don\\'t always make the right choice. Peoples opinions influence your decision making. Hearing another persons point of view is helpful. In your mind you have little voices that have an affect on your decisions. In my opinion, I like having more than one choice. Whenever I have to make an important decision I go and ask my friends for their opinion on the situation. I have been through some situations where I needed help from someone to help me decide what choice i should make. Peer pressure is a good example on making good choices. Imagine your in a room full of kids older than you, They ask you \"come try this drink\". You know your not old enough to be drinking, yet you still ask your friends if you should do it or not. All of your friends tell you \"No\" ,so you decide not to do it. Deciding on certain things isn\\'t easy.\\n\\nBy getting someone else\\'s point of view, You can look at things in a different way. If you don\\'t ask for an opinion their could be a chance you could\\'ve done things differently. Imagine your finally going to buy the sneakers you\\'ve been wanting for a really long time. If one of your friends say they don\\'t like them, then you start thinking about them in a different way, they changed your opinion right? Other peoples opinions will either affect your choices in a good way or a bad way. You have to keep in mind that your opinion is the one that matters the most.\\n\\nIf someone already went through what your going through then their opinion can make you decide things differently. If you have and older brother or sister they give you advice right? When they say stuff like \"trust me i know how it feels like\" it\\'s because they don\\'t want to see you go through the same thing as them. A lot of people have been in the same position as you once in their life, so why not go to them and ask them what they think.

Their advice can help you make a good decision.\\n\\nHaving more than one persons opinion is very helpful. Everyone thinks differently and will help you make the right choice.

For example, a song, dance, modal of what they researched, or maybe an interview with an expert in that field. Having fun is an important part of this project. The fun in the project spurs the student to learn more for the project and with luck, continue to research and look up facts own their own, without the need of a project to guide them forwards.\\n\\nTeachers\\xa0are incapable of filling the need of unique projects for each student. When assigning projects, they assign a single topic that can be worked on, and with strict guidelines on how the project must be completed. This formula usually ends with frustration on both parties as the students are unhappy at the constraints placed upon them, and the teacher is unhappy as they become apparent to the fact that they can't conform to every students needs without spending all of their time or making other students upset.\\n\\nA student is always willing to do more work if the student enjoys the work. Having the students deign the project that fits their needs individually, rather than a one-project-fits-all, teachers will not have any more work than before, students will enjoy their projects more, and project scores will rise.\",\n",
       " 'I think that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. It would give students more flexibility and control over their learning experience. For example, if a student is sick or has a family emergency, they could still attend class from home and not fall behind in their studies.\\n\\nAdditionally, some students may feel more comfortable and focused in their own environment, which could lead to better academic performance. Distance learning would also allow students to learn at their own pace and review material as needed.\\n\\nHowever, there are also potential drawbacks to distance learning. Some students may struggle with self-discipline and motivation without the structure of a traditional classroom. Additionally, there may be technical difficulties with online or video conferencing that could disrupt the learning process.\\n\\nOverall, I believe that distance learning could be a valuable option for students, but it should be used in conjunction with traditional classroom instruction to ensure a well-rounded education.',\n",
       " \"Standardized tests has been a big part of our education system for a long time now. But the question is, do they really show how smart a student is? In my opinion, they don't.\\n\\nFirst of all, standardized tests only measure a small part of what a student knows. They focus mainly on math and reading, but there's so much more to being smart than just those two subjects. What about science, history, and the arts? Those are important too, but they're not usually included in standardized tests. So, a student could be amazing in those areas, but still do poorly on the test just because they're not as good at math or reading. That's not fair.\\n\\nAnother thing is, standardized tests are too narrow. They only test what a student has learned in school, but there's so much more to life than what we learn in the classroom. For example, a student could be really good at problem-solving, or have amazing critical thinking skills, but those things don't get tested. Or, a student could have learned a lot from their family, community, or cultural background, but those things don't get recognized either.\\n\\nFurthermore, standardized tests are often biased. They're usually made by people who are not from the same background as the students who take them. So, they might not understand the experiences and perspectives of those students. For instance, a test question might be about a topic that's not relevant to a student's culture, or it might use language that's not familiar to them. That puts those students at a disadvantage, and it's not their fault.\\n\\nFinally, standardized tests put too much pressure on students. They're often used to decide whether a student can graduate, or whether a school gets funding. That means students feel like they have to do well on the test, or else. It's a lot of stress, and it takes away from the real purpose of education, which is to learn and grow.\\n\\nIn conclusion, standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability. They're too narrow, biased, and put too much pressure on students. There are better ways to measure how smart a student is, like projects, presentations, and portfolios that showcase a student's overall skills and knowledge. We should focus on those instead of standardized tests.\",\n",
       " 'Dear State Senator,\\n\\nI think that our president\\'s should be chosen by popular vote because they have better chances of winning and they will know how many people agree with what they are trying to do in the United States.\\n\\nThe president\\'s have better chances of winning because they can have the most votes and wouldn\\'t have to wait on the Electoral College. Such as paragraph 9 says, \"Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" I think that was unfair because Al Gore could of been the president but instead he was not, after all the campaigning he did to get those voters to vote for him it ended up as a waste because the voting didn\\'t get him anywhere. If I was a president I would be highly upset because I knew I could have a big chance of losing just because of the Electoral College. What doesn\\'t make any sense to me is that the voters are not voting for the president but are voting for a slate of electors. What\\'s the whole point of voting then? People are out here voting for electors that they don\\'t even know and most of the electors are people who not holding public office. In paragraph 13 it says, \"During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn\\'t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn\\'t get to see a single campaign ad.\" To me they are cheating people out of their votes, people vote for the one that they think could make a change not just voting just to be voting.\\n\\nThe president would know how many people agree with what they are trying to do in the United States. The electoral college votes won\\'t help them know who is really for them and who\\'s not because if someone win over electoral votes there are going to be people out there mad about the fact that they had won. This will make people not want to vote at all because 9 times out of 10 the person they are voting for gone lose. The electoral college just makes it difficult for the people that are running for president. I\\'m not saying that it should be easy to just become something big, but if you worked hard enough I think that you should be honored enough to become president through popular votes. This will make the incoming president feel appreciated for all the hard work they did to recieve all these votes. They will know that what they are trying to set forward is good for some people and not just for them. Such as paragraph 12 says, \"Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote.\" What would happen then? That\\'s why you should just give it to the person with the most votes because they deserve it.\\n\\nI hope what I have really proved my argument that we should change the way a president is chosen so it can be fair to everyone. I think this will make the incoming president feel confident in himself to make this happen.\\n\\nSincerley,\\n\\nPROPER_NAME       \\xa0    ',\n",
       " 'As an eighth-grade student, I strongly believe that Generic_School should not extend the school day two hours. While it may seem like an easy solution to address issues such as overcrowding and lack of resources, the potential negative effects on students and teachers far outweigh any benefits that may be gained.\\n\\nFirstly, extending the school day would place a significant burden on students and their families. Many students already struggle to balance their academic and extracurricular commitments, and adding two more hours to the school day would only make this more difficult. This could lead to increased stress levels, decreased participation in extracurricular activities, and even mental health issues such as anxiety and depression.\\n\\nSecondly, teachers would also be impacted by the extended school day. They would be required to work longer hours, which could lead to burnout and decreased job satisfaction. This could ultimately result in a decrease in the quality of education provided to students, as well as a decrease in the number of qualified teachers available to teach.\\n\\nFurthermore, the school day already provides ample time for students to learn and grow. Studies have shown that students learn best when they have regular breaks and opportunities for rest and relaxation. Extending the school day would not provide these opportunities, and could even lead to a decrease in overall academic performance.\\n\\nLastly, there are more effective solutions to address issues such as overcrowding and lack of resources. For example, the school could consider implementing a block scheduling system, which would allow for more efficient use of time and resources. Alternatively, the school could explore alternative methods of providing education, such as online learning or apprenticeships.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that Generic_School should not extend the school day two hours. The potential negative effects on students and teachers far outweigh any benefits that may be gained. Instead, the school should explore alternative solutions that would provide a more balanced and effective education for all students.',\n",

       " \"Graduating Early is a Bad Idea\\n\\nPersonally I think graduating in three years instead of the traditional four years should not be allowed. School should really think about this idea before making it an actual thing, because for some students this could be a good thing, but for some students this could be really bad.\\n\\nGraduating early to me is a bad idea because, I dont think it gives students the right amount of time to learn everything they need to learn while being in high school. In high school students go through situations, make mistakes and bad decisions, learn how to fix those things and not do them again. Students find what they really like to do in life while being in high school but some students need a lot of time to find out what is that thing that they love and want to do for the rest of their lives. Students that play sports need to play for a good amount of time to get better at it and maybe get an scholarship, students that take mechanic courses or photography courses need a good amount of time to learn about everything they need to dominate on whatever they do, so that way colleges can come to their school, watch them and find out if they deserve a scholarship or not. While being in high school, students learn how to adapt to new environments, new people and even different languages so that way when they go to college they are ready for anything. Students that do want to follow this plan and graduate a year early, are going to have to go to school during the summers or in the evinings, if students do that then they won't be able to get a job and work what being in hish school and they won't be able to learn to manage their money and to figure out what's good or bad for them economically.\\n\\nI have a friend her name is Generic_Name, she graduated a year early because she took online classes and stayed after school to graduate a year early.

Generic_Name and I talk everyday and she tells me about everything she goes through, she tells me she can't get a boyfriend because she doesn't know how to maintain a healthy relationship, she tells me she's having economical problems because she's doesn't know how to manage her money because while being in high school she worried more about getting her credits than actually learning what she had to learn to be ready to the real world.\\n\\nIn conclusion I think is a bad idea for schools to allow students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years of high school.

While technology has brought many benefits, it has also had a significant impact on our social skills, especially among young generations. In this essay, I will discuss how technology interferes with students' social skills in the classroom, explore bullying on the internet, discuss the dangers of online trolling and fake news posts on social media, and propose methods to reduce the limitation of human contact due to technology.\\n\\nOne of the most significant impacts of technology on social skills is the way it has changed the way we communicate. With the rise of social media and instant messaging, people are now more likely to communicate through screens than in person. This has led to a decline in face-to-face communication, which is essential for developing social skills. In the classroom, this can be particularly problematic, as students are less likely to interact with each other and build relationships.\\n\\nBullying on the internet is another significant issue that has arisen due to technology. With the rise of social media, it has become easier for bullies to harass and torment their victims. One real-life example of this is the case of Monica Lewinsky, who was subjected to intense bullying and harassment after her affair with former President Bill Clinton. This bullying continued for years, and Lewinsky has since become an advocate for victims of online harassment.\\n\\nOnline trolling and fake news posts on social media are also significant dangers that have arisen due to technology. Trolls are people who intentionally harass and provoke others online, often using fake accounts or multiple accounts to amplify their impact. Fake news posts are another issue, as they can spread false information and incite panic or violence. These dangers have become increasingly prevalent in recent years, and it is essential to be aware of them.\\n\\nTo reduce the limitation of human contact due to technology, there are several methods that can be implemented. One approach is to encourage face-to-face communication in the classroom. Teachers can organize activities that require students to interact with each other, such as group projects or debates. Another approach is to educate students about the dangers of online bullying and harassment, and to provide them with the tools to report and block ab\",\n",

       " '\"All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change\" (Rosenthal source 1) said Transportation of America official David Goldberg in Elisabeth Rosenthal\\'s article \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.\" With air pollution, smog, and greenhouse gas emissions rising all around the world, officials have announced that cars are to blame. With this, many are resorting to making changes in their communities by offering alternate means of transportation and bringing homes and stores closer together. The advantages of limiting car usage include fuel will no longer pollute the air, alternate transportation is available and cheaper, and it would enforce goodwill and communionship.\\n\\nTo begin, a benifit of limiting our car usage is fuel pollutes the air by circulating green house gasses that can cause a dangerous enviroment to form and by limiting cars we limit this pollution. With President Obama\\'s issue to decrease the amount of air pollution caused by cars, many have realized that car usage is not as common as it used to be. If the number of cars on the road continues to deplete- \"and many sociologists believe it will-it will have benificial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment, since transportation is the second largest source of America\\'s emissions, just behind power plants\" (Rosenthal source 4) says Rosenthal in her article \"The End of Car Culture.\" By keeping track and trying to deplete the time you spend driving your car the trend of putting air pollution to an end will increase.\\n\\nAdditionally, a benifit of limiting our car usage is being able to use the cheaper and more efficient alternate means of transportation. By using alternate means of transportation such as buses, trains, and car pooling services you are saving gas money and supporting community business\\'. There is a rise in car pooling that has \"facilitated more flexable commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work\" (Rosenthal source 4) says Rosenthal. As these changes manifest many people are chosing not to switch back to driving themselvs.\\n\\nFinally, a benifit of limiting our car usage can be found in the better communionship that will result as cities will make their stores closer together and communities more closley knit. In Bogota, Colombia people are practicing \"car-free days\" and relying solely on public transportation. As this happens author of article \"Care-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,\" Andrew Selsy, says \"parks and sports centers [are] bloom[ing] throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up\" (Selsky source 3). Other places implementing car-free districts will never hear the roars of engines drowning out the chirping of the birds or childrens laughter. Infact, stores and public transportation is stratigically placed a walking distance away thus promoting social and physical benifits (Rosenthal source 1).\\n\\nThe advantages of limiting car usage include fuel will no longer pollute the air, alternate transportation is available and cheaper, and it would enforce goodwill and communionship. With greenhouse gasses rapidly circulating and polluting the globe it would be acceptional to decrease this by not driving as often. Furthermore, by using alternate transportation such as car pooling or taking a bus money is saved on gas and car repairs. Finally, goodwill and good social habits would increase as towns would become more closley knit as everything would only be a walk away. With this it we should limit our car usage to \"save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve saftey\" (Rosenthal source 4).\\n\\nWork Cited:\\n\\nDuffer, Robert. \"Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog.\"\\n\\nChicago Tribune .

This sense of connectedness will likely provide students with a sense of comfort and security and can help to reduce any anxiety or stress levels that they may experience while at school.\\n\\nFrom a teacher’s perspective, students having access to their cell phones can provide a number of benefits. For example, when an emergency or urgent situation arises, teachers can easily contact students’ parents or guardians using their cell phones. Furthermore, allowing students to have access to their cell phones also provides a helpful distraction for those students who have trouble focusing in class. \\n\\nIn conclusion, allowing students to have access to their cell phones while at school could be a beneficial policy for both students and teachers alike. With the various educational resources, stress-reducing capabilities, and contact options provided by cell phones, it is clear that policy one should be implemented in the school system.',\n",
       " \"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that requiring students to take an arts class has both positive and negative effects on their education. While the arts provide numerous benefits such as creativity and self-expression, they can also take away time and resources from other subjects.\\n\\nOne positive effect of an arts class requirement is that it allows students to explore their creative side. Through the arts, students can express themselves and develop their imagination. For example, in a painting class, students can learn different techniques and styles, and express their emotions and thoughts through their artwork. This can lead to a greater sense of self-awareness and personal growth.\\n\\nAnother positive effect of an arts class requirement is that it can enhance a student's academic performance in other subjects. The arts have been shown to improve critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills. For example, in a drama class, students can learn to analyze and interpret complex characters and situations, which can improve their analytical skills in other subjects such as English or history.\\n\\nHowever, there are also negative effects to consider. One potential downside of an arts class requirement is that it can take away time and resources from other subjects. For example, if students are required to take an arts class for a certain number of hours each week, this can reduce the time they have for other subjects such as math or science. This can lead to a lower overall academic performance.\\n\\nAnother potential downside of an arts class requirement is that it may not be suitable for all students. Some students may not have an interest in the arts or may not have the necessary skills to excel in an arts class. In these cases, the requirement may be a waste of time and resources for the student.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while an arts class requirement can provide numerous benefits such as creativity and self-expression, it can also take away time and resources from other subjects and may not be suitable for all students. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the pros and cons before implementing such a requirement in the education system.\",\n",
       " 'The Electoral College is a process by which we vote for electors- not actually the president themself. When you vote for the electors, they decide who will be the president. We, as voters, have a right to be able to vote for whomever we choose; not someone to choose for us. We should change the Electoral College to election by popular vote because it gives the people a say in who runs our country, an easier way to elect persons into office, and no one state has more of a say.\\n\\nMany poeple believe that we are voting for the president when we vote for our electors, but in reality, we are voting for them to vote. We, as the people of the United States of America, have always had the right to freedom (freedom of speech, religion, ect.)- so why don\\'t we have the freedom to directly choose our president? In the source, \\'The Indefensible Electoral Coolege: Why even the best-laid defences of the system are wrong\\', it states \"...voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" This means that we do not vote directly, only for someone else to decide our fate. Written in the text fo the first source, \\'What Is the Electoral College?\\', it reads \"...when you vote for your canidate you are actually voting for your canidate\\'s elecotrs.\" With this method, we are never getting results directly, only becoming the middle-man when we should be front and center.\\n\\nMost think that if we have electors we won\\'t have as much trouble getting a person in office. In the eleventh paragraph, in \\'Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral Coolege: Why even the best-laid defences of the system are wrong\\', under \\'What\\'s wrong with the electoral college\\', its speaks of a \"disaster factor\". The \"disaster factor\" is when we vote for electors and they defy the will of the people; as this had almost happened with segregationists, nearly making the popular vote for Kennedy not go to Kennedy. As well as the fact that we could easily of had a tie in the electoral vote. As it says in the second source, the matter would fall into the hands of the House of Representatives \"...the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.\" This means each state has one vote, meaning the will of the people wouldn\\'t have much say in the election.\\n\\nPeople in a state all have the same electors, made by a popular vote, practically taking away the people\\'s voice. If things were to change to popular vote we would all have a say in each election. In the Electoral College way of voting, it is \"...unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takes-all system in each state.\" Along with the fact that in the Electoral College way, the amount of electors is based on population, making the people of a small state insignifigant. \"During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn\\'t see the canidates at all...\" If all small states stay this way, they may never be able to have a say in any big decision made by the public.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we, as the people of the United States of America, need to inderstand that the road we are headed down with the Electoral College, is not a good road. We need to stand up and allow everyone to be able to have a say in elections. With the popular vote every citizen will have they\\'re own say in what gets made of our beautiful country. We, the people, need to make the change from Electoral College voting to popular vote becauseit gives people a say in who runs our country, an eaier way to elect someone into office, and no one state has more of a say than another.

       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nUpon the development of handheld computers, more commonly known as \"smart phones,\" the question arises whether, when driving, they are a necessity or a deterrent. Both sides of the argument induced by this question are accurate in some way and folly in another; and so there will always be debate over the subject, with both sides just as right and just as wrong as the other for different reasons. To elaborate upon this further, one might argue that phones should not be allowed in motorized vehicles while they are being operated due to the implication of a distraction. On the other hand, however, one might also argue the necessity of GPS and availability for work. Some laws are put in place to help prevent accidents through negligence because of the need to sometimes carry a device; the only trouble is that people abuse the rights they do have and many can be found texting or holding a phone up to their ear with only one hand or nothing but their knee on the steering wheel. Not only do those drivers have less control of the steering wheel, but they also often get distracted by conversation and drive recklessly. These individuals are the ones the counter argument against phones in motor vehicles will often refer to. The argument about phones and driving is controversial to say the least, and while often neglected it is important to carefully analyze all factors contributing before speaking or constructing an argument or opinion about the subject.\\n\\nCell phones did not exist when cars were first beginning to be produced on a massive scale in 1908 with Henry Ford\\'s Model T, and wouldn\\'t exist for another sixty five years after its development. Laws were never necessary for the implication of cellphones because they did not yet exist, but when cellphones were invented they, in certain cases, became a real problem for people on the road. Since then the cell phone has advanced in an amazing way, rather than a big brick . The first computer was a enormous invention, large enough that one could easily fill an entire room. Today, we have advanced so much on the principle of the computer that we have eventually developed a hand held portable computer that is now in everybody\\'s pockets. Also to be noted is that the first cellular phone was by no means the super computers they are today; they too were big and bulky, and were only good for making phone calls like an ordinary telephone. These amazing advancements have become the very necessities we rely on today, the great majority of which developed only in recent years, and are now staples of modern society.\\n\\nThe most controversial subject outside of laws already put in place about cell phones and driving is manner of necessity, and manner of liability.\\n\\nThere is no one correct party in this argument, because there is always a valid and considerable counter argument to every point which can be made on either which side; wherefore every argument which can be made is only a half truth. The folly of individuals on both polarities of the argument is the inability to understand the importance or reason behind any opinion that in any way opposes their own. The fact of the matter is, neither of which party is entirely correct in their accusations based on the bias of their opinion on the subject. Cell phones are an important and useful tool, whether you need to carry one at all times for work or simply the convenience of having a device with which you can get ahold of outside sources in dire conditions and utilize the availability of GPS if needed. People should most certainly keep their cell phones with them while their driving; but people are often known to abuse this right by recklessly focusing on their device at unnecessary times when driving. To utilize your device properly is the best option rather than to follow each extreme of all or nothing, but the problem still stands and will always stand for the sheer fact that motorized vehicles and cell phones simply exist that there will be those who will not follow this code of conduct, despite any laws which could be implemented.\\n\\nThe general population needs to be encouraged somehow to go about their business responsibly. Unfortunately, this is next to impossible to achieve by any conceivable means on a large scale, and certainly impossible to convince every individual entirely. This will always be a problem in society with any and all causes, and it is up to the rest to withhold these laws and maintain both order and safety. The only thing people can truly do to resolve a situation where somebody is recklessly driving due to negligence while texting or otherwise using their mobile device, is to report the incident to law enforcement for the safety of other individuals on the road. Motorized vehicles are a wonderful utility but they are unsafe, accidents can happen simply by not being careful and often result in death or serious injury.\\n\\nThe best and only thing we can do is to just drive with caution and alertness at all times, especially considering that people are unpredictable and anything can happen on the road.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\n3 1      ',\n",

       " 'Title: The Pros and Cons of Changing the Typical School Day\\n\\nAs an 8th grader, I have been thinking a lot about the school day and how it could be improved. In my opinion, one of the biggest problems with the typical school day is that it can be too long and rigid. Many students, including myself, find it difficult to focus and stay engaged in classes that last for hours on end. This can lead to a lack of motivation and interest in learning, which can have negative effects on our academic performance.\\n\\nOne possible solution to this problem is to shorten the length of the school day and add more elective classes. Electives are classes that students can choose to take based on their interests, such as art, music, or sports. These classes can provide students with a break from the rigid structure of the regular school day and give them the opportunity to explore their passions. Additionally, electives can help students develop new skills and interests that can benefit them in the long run.\\n\\nAnother alternative to longer classes is to offer tutorials for students who need extra help. Tutorials are small group sessions where students can receive individualized attention and support from teachers. This can be especially helpful for students who are struggling in certain subjects or who need extra practice outside of the classroom. Tutorials can provide students with the extra support they need to succeed, without adding more time to the school day.\\n\\nHowever, there are also some potential downsides to changing the typical school day. For example, if the school day is shorter, students may not have enough time to cover all of the material they need to learn. This could lead to a lack of depth in their knowledge and skills. Additionally, some students may not have access to elective classes or tutorials if they do not have the resources or support at home.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while there are both pros and cons to changing the typical school day, I believe that it is important to consider the needs and interests of individual students. By offering more elective classes and tutorials, students can have a more engaging and personalized learning experience. However, it is also important to ensure that all students have access to these opportunities, regardless of their background or circumstances. Ultimately, the goal of the school day should be to provide students with the best possible education and support, while also taking into account their individual needs and interests',\n",
       " \" In today's world, energy conservation and resource preservation are crucial. However, not everyone follows these practices, which can have negative consequences. For example, simply turning off lights at home when not in use can save energy. Similarly, students who use their computers at school for extended periods, such as playing games or charging, are wasting energy. Unfortunately, not everyone understands the importance of energy conservation.\\n\\nOne solution to this problem is for businesses and schools to adopt a four-day work week. This would allow workers to have an extra day off each week, giving them more time to rest and spend with their families. Additionally, working four days a week would decrease the use of energy, as fewer people would be using power tools such as computers, printers, and construction tools.\\n\\nAnother benefit of a four-day work week is that it would reduce the amount of energy and resources wasted by commuting. Some people drive to work, while others take the bus, and using this method would save energy and resources such as gasoline, money, and vehicles.\\n\\nHowever, there are also potential disadvantages to a four-day work week. For example, students would need to attend school for longer hours, which could lead to increased energy use. Additionally, workers would still be required to work for the same amount of time each day, which could lead to the same amount of energy being wasted.\\n\\nDespite these potential disadvantages, there are benefits to a four-day work week for students. For example, they would have more time to complete their homework and study for tests. Additionally, using this method, students and teachers would save resources and energy by not having to use computers and paper as much.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while there are potential disadvantages to a four-day work week, there are also many benefits. By reducing the amount of energy and resources wasted by commuting and work, we can conserve our resources for the future. Businesses and schools should consider adopting a four-day work week to promote energy conservation and resource preservation.\",\n",
       " \" In today's world, technology has revolutionized the way we learn and interact with each other. One of the most popular trends in education is distance learning, which allows students to attend classes remotely through online or video conferencing. While some students may benefit from this option, I believe that attending classes from home has its drawbacks. In this essay, I will argue that students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home, and that the distractions and lack of energy and concentration that come with studying from home are too great to overcome.\\n\\nOne of the biggest disadvantages of studying from home is the potential for distractions. When you are in a classroom, you are surrounded by other students who are also focused on the material at hand. However, when you are studying from home, it can be easy to get distracted by other activities. For example, you might start watching a movie or playing a video game instead of doing your homework. This can lead to a reduction in your grade, as you will not have completed the necessary work on time.\\n\\nAnother issue with studying from home is the lack of energy and concentration that comes with it. When you are in a classroom, you are exposed to a variety of stimuli, such as the energy of your classmates, the enthusiasm of your teacher, and the excitement of the material you are learning. However, when you are studying from home, you are often surrounded by a more quiet and sedentary environment. This can make it difficult to maintain the same level of energy and concentration that you would in a classroom.\\n\\nIn addition to these issues, there are also practical concerns with studying from home. For example, unexpected events can occur that can affect your ability to complete your work. For example, a family member might die, have a car accident, or have a work schedule that conflicts with your study schedule. These unexpected events can take away your time and energy, making it difficult to stay on track with your studies.\\n\\nDespite these challenges, some students may argue that they can benefit from being able to attend classes from home. For example, they may be able to study at a more convenient time, or they may be able to study in a location that is more comfortable for them. However, I believe that the benefits of attending classes in person far outweigh the benefits of studying from home.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while distance learning may be a\",\n",

Additionally, my interest in the job shows that I am committed to being a valuable asset to your team.\\n\\nRespect is another trait that I take very seriously. I show respect to everyone, regardless of their position or relationship to me. I believe that respect is essential in any workplace, and it is a quality that I will always carry with me. For instance, if I were to come to work in a bad mood and speak negatively to my colleagues, I could lose my job. Therefore, I always strive to be in the best attitude possible, even when dealing with challenging situations outside of work.\\n\\nI am confident that I can handle any amount of responsibilities that come my way. If you were to give me two stacks of paper and two days to fill them out, I would complete the task.

For example, if I were given the opportunity to work with kindergartners who were struggling to comprehend the material being taught, I would stay after school with them until they understood and were able to complete the task. I would go above and beyond to help these children succeed.\\n\\nIn addition to my well-rounded nature, respectful demeanor, and responsibility, I am also a great communicator. I am confident that I can communicate effectively with students, parents, and colleagues. For example, if I were to have a student who was struggling with a particular concept, I would take the time to explain it to them in a way that they could understand. I would also make sure to communicate regularly with parents, keeping them informed of their child\",\n",

This can be due to a variety of factors, such as stress, fatigue, or a change in circumstances.\\n\\nFurthermore, it is important to note that first impressions can be misleading. People may judge others based on their initial interactions, but these impressions can be quickly formed and may not accurately reflect a person's true personality.\\n\\nIt is also possible for people to have different personalities depending on the situation.

Although there is the idea that it is important for students to also develop individually in moments instead of a curriculum based way, this is not true for summer projects. Students don\\'t fully know what the next course entails; whereas, teachers do know. Students can create projects that do not allow for them to be prepared for the year, or projects that cover the wrong part of their next course. This individuality also creates a divide in the knowledge of the students entering their next year, creating a difficult circumstance for the teacher of said class. With the divide in knowledge the teacher would have to compensate and reteach certain parts that should have already been covered and reviewed in the summer project.

Teachers follow the curriculum, and will do the same in their assigned summer projects. This curriculum based activity is exactly what students need to be prepared for their classes. These teacher based assignments also make sure that the brain, which isn\\'t fully developed until the age of twenty five is properly brought up.

Schools that require students to complete a summer project to make sure they continue learning, should have the teachers design the projects, because getting the teachers to choose what their students projects should be about, helps expand the students knowledge, it gives the teacher security that the students will do the project as expected and it also get the students out their own comfort zones.\\n\\nFirst, schools that require students to complete a summer project, should have the teachers design the projects, because it will help expand the students knowledge. For example, if students know little to nothing on the topic given to them, they will discover facts they didn't even know existed. In addition, if the students discover interesting facts about the topic given them, it would encourage them to do some more research on the topic; therefore, expanding their knowledge even more than before.\\n\\nNext, schools that require students to complete a summer project, should have the teachers design the projects, because it will give the teacher security that the students will do the project as expected. For example, if the students were to chose the way they design their projects, it would never get done because they'd procrastinate. However, we can't say for sure that the students will do their summer projects if the topics or the way it is designed is given to them, but we can say for sure it give the teacher the reassurance they need.\\n\\nFinally, schools that require students to complete a summer project, should have the teachers design the projects, because it also will get the students out their own comfort zones. For example, if students were to chose the way their projects are made or what topic to make it about. It would be about something they have knowledge of, something thats within their comfort zone. Although, most students like to stay within their comfort zones, it's good to expand that comfort. You never know what you might find and catch of interest.\\n\\nIn conclusion, schools that require students to complete a summer project to make sure they continue learning during break, should require the teachers to design the projects because it helps the students expand their knowledge, gives the teacher security that the students will get their projects done during break, and last but not least, it gets the students out of their own comfort zones.\",\n",
       " \"In today's world, cell phones have become an essential part of our lives. They are not only used for communication but also for various other purposes like navigation, internet access, and entertainment. However, the use of cell phones while driving a vehicle has been a controversial issue. Some people believe that drivers should be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle, while others argue that it is a dangerous practice that should be banned. In my opinion, drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, using a cell phone while driving can be a major distraction for the driver. When a driver is talking on the phone or texting, their attention is diverted from the road, which can lead to accidents. According to a study, using a cell phone while driving increases the risk of a car crash by four times. Moreover, drivers who use cell phones while driving are more likely to miss traffic signals and road signs, which can result in serious accidents.\\n\\nSecondly, using a cell phone while driving can also be a distraction for other drivers on the road. When drivers see someone using a cell phone while driving, they tend to get curious and try to see what the driver is doing. This can cause them to lose focus and increase the risk of an accident.\\n\\nLastly, the use of cell phones while driving is illegal in many states and countries. In the United States, many states have banned the use of hand-held cell phones while driving. Some states even have laws that prohibit the use of hands-free devices while driving. This shows that the use of cell phones while driving is considered a serious safety concern by lawmakers.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the use of cell phones while driving should be strictly prohibited. It is a dangerous practice that can lead to accidents and put the lives of the driver and others on the road at risk. Instead, drivers should focus on driving safely and avoid any distractions that can take their attention away from the road.\",\n",

       " \"Dear TEACHER_NAME,\\n\\nI have recently heard that you are debating if students bring their phones to school or not. Honestly, my say might not do you any good. But, I feel that it is a great idea. On the other hand, students that do not bring their phones to school might be an issue. How so?\\n\\nyou might ask. In these next few paragraphs, I will explain my doing and hopefully you will see to taking in my opinion and proposition.\\n\\nAllowing students to bring their phones to school, and to use them during free time, is a wonderful idea. Also, keeping them off during class time is a good deal to at least being able to have the phones in the students' possession. It would be easier if teachers could see students on their phones and not take them away. We the students would not have to sneak the phones around school, and get later caught. The only minor problem is that students might not turn them off during class, disregarding your trust and rules. Otherwise, It is a good idea. What if something were to happen to that particular student? What if it was a personal problem and they could not come to a teacher? Reasons for having phones during school can go on for quite some time, but to keep it short and simple, It would be a great idea to have them during school. But why keep the phones away from the students?\\n\\nWhy can we not have the phones? Why take them away? Students need phones as if they need oxygen to breathe. It is legit that even if you banned phones from school property, students would still bring and use them anyway. There is honestly no point. Sometimes they do go off during class, but it is not on purpose. I do understand the statement that phones are in fact distracting to the students and classmates. If you banned them, students would not be distracted, or taking the risk of exposure to the phones, causing them to be possessed by teachers and administrators. What's my opinion?\\n\\nIn my personal belief, I feel that we should be able to have our phones. It is a legitimate trade for keeping and using the phones during free time and lunch, and keeping them off during the time of class and learning. If you allow this, students would be grateful and pleased, as well as the teachers and other workers at this school. Thank you for taking the time to examine my opinion and personal distress.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME\",\n",
       " 'One of the steps that can be taken to make school lunches more enjoyable for students is to serve fresher, healthier foods. This can be achieved by including more fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as wholesome whole grains, lean proteins, and other healthful components. Additionally, school lunches should be prepared in a safe and hygienic manner, with kitchen staff following best practices of sanitizing and cooking food thoroughly. \\n\\nTo address the potential consequence of removing popular items from school lunch menus, alternative foods can be offered as substitutes. The goal should be to provide options that still provide nutritional benefits, without sacrificing the taste and enjoyment for students. For example, healthier versions of macaroni and cheese, pizza, and taco dishes can be created that retain the traditional flavor profile while providing a nutrient-rich meal. \\n\\nBy taking these steps, schools can create more enjoyable and nutritionally sound lunch options for their students.',\n",
       " \"Hey, so like, I know cell phones are pretty much a necessary thing these days, but I'm like, totally unsure if they should be allowed in school. On one hand, they can be really helpful for learning, like, you know, looking up stuff and stuff. But on the other hand, they can be super distracting and stuff.\\n\\nSo, like, let's talk about the benefits first. I mean, cell phones can be super helpful for learning. You can look up stuff, like, quick, when you're in class and stuff. It's like, way easier than getting up and going to the library or whatever. Plus, you can use them to take notes and stuff, which can be way more organized than writing it all down by hand. And, like, you can use them to communicate with your friends during class, which can be cool.\\n\\nBut, like, there are also some pretty big drawbacks to allowing cell phones in school. For one, they can be super distracting. Like, you'll be in class, trying to learn, and then someone will be on their phone and it's like, totally taking away from the learning experience. And, like, sometimes people will be on their phones during tests and stuff, which is, like, totally cheating. And, like, it's just not fair to the people who don't have phones or can't afford them.\\n\\nSo, like, I'm not sure if confiscating them is the best solution. I mean, it might work, but it could also be super unfair to the people who need them for learning. And, like, it would be super hard to enforce. I mean, how do you even confiscate someone's phone without them getting mad or whatever? It's just, like, not worth it.\\n\\nSo, like, I think maybe there could be some middle ground. Like, maybe we could have designated phone times, like, during breaks or something. That way, people can use their phones when they need to, but they won't be distracted during class. And, like, maybe we could have some apps or something that help us learn stuff, like, more efficiently. That way, we can use our phones for good and not just for, like,\",\n",
       " 'Dear State Senator,\\n\\nWhat do you think of the Electoral College and how it plays a unfair role into elections? Shouldn\\'t the man or woman with the most popular vote be the president? It isn\\'t fair for the people because if more people want that particular person elected then why shouldn\\'t he be elected? He has more people on his side after all doesn\\'t he? These are all questions you should be asking yourself because you as State Senator have the power to abolish our states Electoral College system. There is in fact several great facts about why we should do away with the Electoral College system. Three of them might be that the Electorcal College system isn\\'t fair between all 50 states, the winner-take-all system isn\\'t fair towards voters, and also the \"disaster factor\" is completely wrong. The Electoral College system is a despised part of our should be fair elections.\\n\\nOur senator have you seen how the electoral vote works? According to the third paragraph in Branford Plumers writings called \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\" it clearly states as a very vaild point that the Electoral College voting system isn\\'t doing it\\'s job. To be precise the voting isn\\'t up to the people at all. What happens is that we the people all go and vote for a president and one obviously has the popular vote. What happens is that the electors put our votes in and say we have mabye three hundred thousand people voting from our state and well you see we don\\'t get that many Electoral College votes towards the president we want. Then say another state gets mabye two hundred thousand and that side has the more people in it\\'s state then us and then they get more electorcal college votes then us but we had the mroe people. Does that seem very fair to you?\\xa0 To continue from there we have the Winner-Take-All system which basically does what the name applies which is that if say one side gets mabye ten more votes towards one canidate then that side gets all the Electoral votes towards that canidate and does that seem right to all the other people just because they got 10 more votes? No it doesn\\'t and its a crime towards all the other people who voted for the other side. Next theres something called the \"Distaster Effect\". The \"Disaster Effect\" is basically that the electors don\\'t have to put in the popular vote. The electors who are chosen by the state legislature actually look at all the votes and vote for a canidate. The more electors that put in a particular vote win and they take all the electoral votes dude to the Winner-Take-All system. The catch to that is the elecotors actually don\\'t have to use the pouplar vote and they can vote for whomever they want to be elected. This is not for the people at all and not even close to it.\\n\\nNow that I have given completely valid reasons can\\'t you see that the Electoral College voting system is biased to serve only the goverment and a few select people. If you used the popular vote system everyone could vote for whom they choose and then we would have fair elections so the true canditate of the people is chosen.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nA Concerned Citizen       \\xa0    ',\n",
       " \"Forcing students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity is an unnecessary decision. In my opinion, I believe that you should only join an activity if you want to. I also believe that extracurricular activities are meant to be completely optional. You shouldn't be forced to do something that you have no interest in doing. Some of the activities may not interest students at all and we want them to have fun, not be extremely bored because they were forced to join an activity. I disagree with the decision to force all students to participate in at least one of the activities because some students don't want to join one, others might not be able to join, and some have things to do outside of school.\\n\\nFirst, some students don't want to participate at all. I wouldn't make them have to do something they have no interest in doing at all. For example, some could care less about playing a sport. They could also probably not care at all about joining a club, or to work on the school yearbook.\\n\\nNext, some students might not be able to participate in an activity. They could be busy with something. They might not have the time to join one or some of the activities. That is the second reason why I disagree with my principal's decision to enforce students to participate in at least one activity.\\n\\nLastly, some students have things to do outside of school. They might not be able to stay back after school for one of the activities. Things like having to watch and take care of your sibling, having to go somewhere are some examples of why students wouldn't have the time to participate. They wouldn't be able to focus on things like sports, clubs, etc.\\n\\nNow some may disagree and say that it's a good idea to make students join an activity but there are some pros and cons. Sure students would be learning more things but I believe that half the people there would be the ones who were forced to join in the first place. There are some benefits to being in an extracurricular activity but i don't think it should be enforced.\\n\\nThat is why I disagree with my principal's decision. Activities shouldn't be mandatory but just an option if you want to try something new out. I hope Generic_Name revokes this decision so we're not forced into something we don't want to do. In conclusion, I don't agree with Generic_Name's decision because some students don't want to join one, aren't able to participate, and some have things to do after and outside of school.\",\n",
       " \"Hey, so for this essay, I gotta talk about how having a positive attitude can lead to success in different situations, like school, relationships, and when we're facing difficult obstacles in life. And I gotta analyze how having a positive attitude can affect the outcomes in these situations.\\n\\nFirst off, having a positive attitude in school can totally help you succeed. When you're positive and motivated, you're more likely to pay attention in class, do your homework, and study for tests. And that means you'll get better grades and stuff. Plus, when you're in a good mood, you're more likely to make friends and get along with your teachers, which can make school way more enjoyable.\\n\\nBut it's not just school. Having a positive attitude in relationships can also lead to success. When you're in a good mood and you're positive, you're more likely to be a good listener, be supportive, and be understanding. And that can help you build stronger relationships with your friends and family. Plus, when you're positive, you're less likely to get upset or mad at little things, which can help you avoid arguments and stuff.\\n\\nAnd finally, having a positive attitude can help you deal with difficult obstacles in life. When you're positive, you're more likely to see challenges as opportunities to learn and grow, rather than as roadblocks that can't be overcome. And that can help you stay motivated and determined to overcome them. Plus, when you're positive, you're more likely to be resilient and bounce back from setbacks, which can help you keep going even when things get tough.\\n\\nSo, like, there are tons of examples of people who have had success from having a positive attitude. For instance, Oprah Winfrey, she's all about positivity and she's super successful. And she's always talking about how having a positive attitude helped her overcome obstacles and achieve her goals. And same with Ellen DeGeneres, she's always spreading positivity and joy, and she's one of the most popular and successful comedians out there.\\n\\nSo yeah, having a positive attitude can totally lead to success in different situations. It can help you succeed in school\",\n",
       " 'She\\'s 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Wait, anger and disgust is rising? Happiness is plummeting? What is happening? The answer is that this emotion reading technology, though interesting, could actually have a very negative effect on the people it is used on. Especially in a class room, one of the most influential places on a childs life. Sure, it is cool being able to read Mona Lisa\\'s emotions, but on real students a facial action coding system would be impractical, invasive, and damaging.\\n\\nBeing able to detect other peoples emotions is a scary idea, but even before diving into the effects it could have on the mind, it\\'s physical restraints are just as daunting. In paragraph seven, the article states \"Your home PC can\\'t handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa\\'s smile.\" Schools are already struggling to keep up with the cost of electronics for thousands of students, and having to get new laptops or computers to implemenet this technology would be extremely expensive and unwise. Especially when many schools have real problems that need to be addressed such as a larger special needs program, or more funding to the band who hasn\\'t gotten new uniforms in twenty years. Then once all this money is invested, what if it does not work. This technology is clearly just starting to develop, and it runs solely on facial muscles. The article tells you how to raise your cheek muscles to show a real smile, surely students would find ways to exploit this and fake emotions, rendering the technology ineffective. Most importantly, schools are a fast paced environment, adding this technology and teaching the students how to use it would waste a lot of time that could have been devoted to learning. The other option would be to implement it and not tell them at all, but that would be a clear invasion of privacy and could get the school in legal and financial trouble.\\n\\nAll of this is assuming the school would even want the technology. It sounds very nifty at a glance, but the idea itself is actually extrememly invasive. Emotions are the secret to what\\'s going on in our brain, all of our deepest thoughts and desires are secretly expressed in our emotions, sometimes very subtley. Kids are very secretive, and would almost certainly not take kindly to having there personal emotions, and by extension, what they are thinking about, out in the open. The author says that this technology in a class room would help recognize when a student becomes \"confused or bored,\" but what about all the other emotions that would come with it: the sadness over a lost loved one, the love a teen is feeling towards their crush. These emotions are deeply personal, and if a child wanted to share them he would tell you. Stealing them away with technology is a clear invasion of privacy.\\n\\nThis type of invasion isn\\'t just unkind, it could, instead of helping, actually damage a students emotional or mental well being. Emotions can be a rollercoaster. Everyone has their own way of handling them , and for some people getting them intensly analyzed is not the answer. In fact, this type of prying could cause students to retract into themself, and lower self confidence. For example, if a teen is always being reminded he is feeling sad, won\\'t that just further his sadness? Then, if students don\\'t want to share their emotions, they may start using their facial muscles to trick the machine into thinking they are feeling a certain way. One of the number one things all psychologists will tell their patients in dealing with emotions is not to cover them up and hide them behind other emotions. Constantly being in a state of hiding with emotions could cause students to snap in a bad way.\\n\\nThe last thing students of any age need is more problems to worry about. Emotions are a large, personal part of anyone\\'s life, and to try and analyze them in a classroom setting would be impractical, invasive, and damaging.',\n",

While some may argue that this approach can provide clarity and direction, I believe that it can have negative consequences on a student's personal and professional growth. In this essay, I will explore the negative consequences of requiring students to identify a career by the time they enter high school and provide examples of individuals who have achieved success by taking nontraditional paths after high school.\\n\\nThe Negative Consequences of Career Identification in High School\\n\\nThe pressure to identify a career path by the time one enters high school can lead to a narrow focus on a specific field, limiting a student's opportunities for exploration and personal growth. Students may feel pressured to choose a career based on their parents' or peers' expectations, rather than their own interests and passions. This can lead to a lack of fulfillment and satisfaction in their chosen career, as they may not have truly explored all of their options.\\n\\nMoreover, the pressure to identify a career path can lead to a lack of flexibility in a student's education and career trajectory. Students may feel that they must take specific courses or pursue certain extracurricular activities in order to achieve their desired career, even if those activities do not align with their true interests or passions. This can lead to a rigid and inflexible approach to education, which can hinder a student's ability to adapt to changes in the job market or their own personal goals.\\n\\nExamples of Successful Nontraditional Paths\\n\\nDespite the pressure to identify a career path by the time one enters high school, many individuals have achieved success by taking nontraditional paths. For example, Oprah Winfrey, one of the most successful media personalities in history, did not attend college and instead began her career as a local news anchor. Similarly, Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, dropped out of high school and instead pursued his passion for technology and innovation.\\n\\nThese individuals, and countless others, have demonstrated that success can be achieved through a variety of nontraditional paths. By exploring their interests and passions, they were able to identify\",\n",

These traits are not only important for success, but they also help individuals to grow and develop as individuals. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of determination and effort in achieving goals.\\n\\nDetermination is the quality of being resolved to do something. It is the drive to keep pushing forward even when faced with obstacles and challenges. Determination is a crucial trait in achieving goals because it helps individuals to stay focused and motivated. When individuals are determined to achieve a goal, they are more likely to put in the necessary effort to make it happen.\\n\\nEffort, on the other hand, is the act of working hard towards a goal. It is the willingness to put in the time and energy required to achieve a goal. Effort is also a crucial trait in achieving goals because it shows that individuals are committed to their goals. When individuals put in the necessary effort, they are more likely to see results and achieve their goals.\\n\\nThe benefits of determination and effort in achieving goals are numerous. Firstly, determination helps individuals to stay motivated and focused. When individuals are determined to achieve a goal, they are more likely to put in the necessary effort to make it happen. This focus and motivation help individuals to overcome obstacles and challenges, making it easier to achieve their goals.\\n\\nSecondly, determination and effort help individuals to develop resilience. When individuals face setbacks and failures, determination helps them to bounce back and continue working towards their goals. This resilience is essential for achieving long-term success, as setbacks and failures are inevitable.\\n\\nThirdly, determination and effort help individuals to develop discipline and self-control. When individuals are determined to achieve a goal, they are more likely to put in the necessary effort to make it happen.

Like that time I tried to build a treehouse and it collapsed mid-construction . Or when I tried out for the basketball team and didn't make the cut . But you know what? Those failures taught me some valuable lessons that have helped me in the long run.\\n\\nFor instance, when I was trying to build that treehouse, I realized that I needed to measure the branches better before constructing the foundation. It was a pretty obvious mistake, but I didn't catch it until it was too late. But because of that failure, I learned to double-check my work and be more careful in the future. And guess what? The next time I tried to build something, it turned out great! \\n\\nAnd let's not forget about my attempt to join the basketball team. At first, I was super disappointed when I didn't make the cut, but then I realized that I had to work on my dribbling and shooting skills. So, I practiced every day after school and before bed until I saw improvement. And guess what? The next time the team had tryouts, I made it! \\n\\nSee, failure isn't always a bad thing. It can actually help us learn and grow, which is super important if we want to achieve success. When we understand why we failed, we can avoid making the same mistakes in the future. It's like when my friend Emily tried to make a chocolate cake for her mom's birthday, but it didn't turn out right. She realized that she needed to use more sugar, so she did the next time, and it was perfect! \\n\\nIn conclusion, failure might seem like a setback, but it can actually be a stepping stone to success. So, don't be afraid to take risks and try new things, even if you're not sure if you'll succeed. Because, let's face it, failure is just a part of life, and it can help us learn and grow in ways we never thought\",\n",

While some may argue that curfews unfairly interfere with young people's lives, I believe that the benefits of curfews far outweigh any potential drawbacks.\\n\\nFirstly, curfews are necessary to ensure that teenagers are not out on the streets at night, which can be dangerous. There are many potential dangers that teenagers may face when they are out late at night, such as being involved in accidents, being targeted by bullies, or getting into illegal activities. By setting a curfew, parents and guardians can ensure that their teenagers are safe and secure at home.\\n\\nSecondly, curfews provide a sense of structure and discipline for teenagers. Teenagers who are not given clear boundaries and expectations may struggle to find their way in the world. By setting a curfew, parents and guardians can establish a clear expectation for when their teenagers should be home and what they should be doing. This can help teenagers develop a sense of responsibility and self-discipline, which can be beneficial in many areas of their lives.\\n\\nFinally, curfews can have potential benefits for teenagers. For example, teenagers who are not out late at night may have more time to focus on their studies and academic performance. Additionally, curfews can help teenagers develop healthy habits and routines, such as getting enough sleep and eating healthy meals.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while some may argue that curfews unfairly interfere with young people's lives, I believe that the benefits of curfews far outweigh any potential drawbacks. Curfews provide safety, structure, and discipline for teenagers, and can have potential benefits for their academic performance and overall well-being.

       " \"In today's fast-paced world, sleep is often neglected, especially among teenagers. Lack of sleep can have detrimental effects on a teenager's physical and mental health. Additionally, not having a curfew can lead to increased risky behavior and a lack of responsibility. In this essay, I will examine the benefits of having a 10pm curfew to provide guidelines for teenagers, analyze potential counter arguments, evaluate the pros and cons of a 10pm curfew for teenagers, and draft an argument for the implementation of a 10pm curfew.\\n\\nFirstly, lack of sleep can have serious consequences on a teenager's physical and mental health. According to the National Sleep Foundation, teenagers need an average of 8-10 hours of sleep per night. However, many teenagers do not get enough sleep due to school, extracurricular activities, and other commitments. This lack of sleep can lead to fatigue, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. Additionally, it can increase the risk of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease later in life.\\n\\nSecondly, not having a curfew can lead to increased risky behavior and a lack of responsibility. Without a curfew, teenagers may be more likely to stay out late, engage in drugs and alcohol, and engage in other dangerous activities. This lack of guidance and responsibility can lead to a lack of self-discipline and a lack of respect for authority.\\n\\nHowever, there are potential counter arguments to a 10pm curfew. Some parents may feel that they have more control over their children when they are at home, and a curfew may limit their ability to monitor their children's activities. Additionally, some teenagers may feel that a curfew is too restrictive and that they are being treated like children.\\n\\nDespite these potential counter arguments, there are benefits to having a 10pm curfew for teenagers. Firstly, it can provide guidelines for healthy sleep habits and help teenagers prioritize their physical and mental health. Additionally, it can promote responsibility and self-discipline, which can benefit teenagers in all areas of their lives.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the benefits of having a 10pm curfew for teenagers far outweigh the potential counter\",\n",

For example, to prevent making poor choices or decisions, to determine which advice is accurate, and to allow someone to feel secure with choices. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.\\n\\nFirst, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by preventing making poor choices or decisions. For instant, if someone attempts to steal. If there's something you want but it's expensive. Also, if someone gets in a fight. If there's someone you don't like or disagree with. Lastly, if someone lies. When someone did something wrong and lied about it. Seeking multiple opinions can help some make a better choice.\\n\\nFurthermore, seeking multiple opinions can help people make a better choice by determining which advice is accurate. For example, to be sure that it's reliable. If many said the same thing while others said a different thing. Also,if someone wasn't sure about the advice. Ask people for more advice if the advice is inaccurate. Lastly, if the advice is inaccurate. If someone said one thing while others said the other thing. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.\\n\\nFinally, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by allowing someone to feel secure with choices.

If someone you know is absent or gone. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.\\n\\nIn summary, viewing many opinions can benefit people to make a better choice by preventing making poor choices or decisions, determining which advice is accurate, and by allowing someone to feel secure with choices. I believe that asking yourself for advice is also necessary. but, viewing many opinions from people is probably more necessary than viewing your own advice.\",\n",

       " 'Introduction:\\nIn the article \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author argues that despite the dangers and difficulties of studying Venus, it is a worthwhile pursuit. The author suggests that studying Venus can help us better understand our own planet, Earth. In this essay, I will evaluate how well the author supports this idea and provide evidence from the article to back up my claim.\\n\\nBody:\\nThe author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthwhile pursuit despite the dangers by highlighting some of the potential benefits of studying Venus. For instance, the author notes that the study of Venus could provide us with valuable information about the Earth\\'s climate system. Venus has a very thick and hot atmosphere that traps heat, causing its surface to reach a temperature of up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Studying these extreme conditions on Venus could help us better understand the impact of global warming on Earth.\\n\\nMoreover, the author argues that understanding the geology and composition of Venus\\'s surface could help us learn about the Earth\\'s formation. Venus and Earth are very similar in size and composition, so it is reasonable to assume that both planets share some similarities in their geological history. Studying Venus could provide us with information about plate tectonics, volcanoes, and other geological phenomena that could help us understand the Earth\\'s past and present.\\n\\nThe author also notes that exploring Venus could be an excellent opportunity to test new technology and techniques for space exploration. For instance, the development of new materials and equipment that could withstand Venus\\'s harsh conditions could help us explore other planets, like Mars or even some exoplanets. The challenges associated with exploring Venus could lead to new breakthroughs and innovations in space exploration technology.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nIn conclusion, the author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" makes a compelling case for studying Venus despite the risks it presents. By highlighting some of the potential benefits of studying Venus, the author makes a compelling argument that exploring Venus could help us better understand our own planet and improve space technology. While there are certainly many challenges that would need to be overcome, the potential benefits of exploring Venus are worth the risk. Therefore, it is worth pursuing further exploration of Venus.',\n",
       " 'The late British Prime Minister Winston Churchill famously declared that “success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.” This statement holds a great deal of truth in its meaning, as while failure is unavoidable, those who maintain enthusiasm when things don’t go their way are able to remain positive and even learn from their mistakes. Learning from failure is essential for success, as an individual who fails and then strives to improve from their experience is likely to reach their desired outcome. Perseverance can be a great asset in this respect, as an individual who does not surrender to failure is more likely to find success in the end. \\n\\nOn the other hand, it is not necessary to fail in order to learn and find success. With careful planning, research and determination, an individual can find success without the added disappointment of failure. It is furthermore possible that an individual may gain a sense of confidence which kernels from a long-term period of success, and will thus be less likely to fail or struggle in future endeavours.',\n",
       " ' Graduating high school in three years has become an increasingly popular choice for some students, but I believe that it is not a good idea. While some students may prefer to graduate all four years and take classes in the summer, others may choose to take those courses and graduate in three years, taking some classes in the summer. However, I believe that graduating high school in four years is a much better option for a variety of reasons.\\n\\nFirstly, graduating high school in four years allows students to spend some time with their families before going into college or the workforce. This is an important time for students to bond with their loved ones and create lasting memories. Taking summer or evening classes to graduate in three years can take up too much time and energy, leaving little time for family and friends.\\n\\nSecondly, graduating high school in four years allows students to take all the elective courses they want. This is an opportunity for students to explore their interests and passions, and potentially discover new career paths. Taking summer or evening classes to graduate in three years can limit the number of elective courses students can take, and may not provide the same level of depth and exploration.\\n\\nFinally, graduating high school in four years allows students to have more time to spend with their family and friends before going into the workforce. This is an important time for students to relax and recharge before starting their next chapter. Taking summer or evening classes to graduate in three years can be overwhelming and stressful, and may not provide the same level of relaxation and enjoyment.\\n\\nIn conclusion, graduating high school in four years is a much better option for students. It allows them to spend time with their families, take all the elective courses they want, and have more time to relax and recharge before going into the workforce. While graduating in three years may seem like a quick and efficient way to get started, the benefits of graduating in four years far outweigh the potential drawbacks.',\n",

While there are many factors to consider when making a decision, I believe that using life experience and guidance from experts is essential.\\n\\nOne of the most important factors to consider when making a decision is personal experience.

Whether it's family, friends, or a mentor, the guidance of others can be invaluable when making decisions. For example, when deciding on a college major, my parents encouraged me to pursue a career in science because they knew that it was a field with many opportunities for growth and success. This guidance gave me the confidence to pursue my passion and helped me make a decision that I am proud of.\\n\\nIn addition to personal experience and guidance from experts, it's also important to consider the potential consequences of our decisions. We must weigh the pros and cons of each option and choose the one that aligns with our values and goals.

There are always new and improved ideas for cars, but some of them may not be in the best interest for people. The idea of a car that drives itself seems both unreliable and unrealistic. After reading this passage the idea of a self-driving car seems like more of a hassle than the number one item on a person\\'s Christmas list.\\n\\nThe \"driverless\" cars of today are far from not needing drivers. Most cars, like the Toyota Prius, have many sensors within the car. Though these sensors do help alert the driver if the car is out of control, they do not fix the siuation or get themselves out of it. I have been in a Toyota Prius on a dangerous, icey road, and the car did alert the driver when we were out of control, but the car did not correct the situation it rather made a loud beeping noise and had a flashing signal on the dash. These cars are not driving themselves, but instead relying on the drivers to pay attention to their warnings.\\n\\nSelf-driving cars are also a problem when it comes to legal situations. Dr. Werner Huber believes that entertainment while driving is a great idea for drivers who still need to pay attention to the road. So what happens when a driver is distracted and does not adhere to their self-driving car\\'s warnings? Well the same probelm that occurs with drivers every day. There will still be wrecks and deaths. These cars are not making the roads a safer place, but instead making legal situations more confusing by not knowing who is at fault for an accident.\\n\\nThough these cars have no large, positive effect on society engineers still continue to work every day on them.

While some may argue that making it an elective would give students more freedom to choose their interests, I believe that an arts class is an essential component of a well-rounded education and should be required for all students.\\n\\nFirstly, the arts provide students with a creative outlet and a way to express themselves. Whether it's through music, dance, theater, or visual arts, the arts allow students to explore their emotions and ideas in a unique and meaningful way. This can lead to increased self-awareness, self-esteem, and overall well-being.\\n\\nSecondly, the arts promote critical thinking and problem-solving skills. When students engage in the arts, they are forced to think creatively and come up with new and innovative ways to express themselves. This can lead to improved problem-solving skills and a better understanding of how to approach complex problems.\\n\\nThirdly, the arts promote cultural awareness and understanding. Through the arts, students can learn about different cultures and traditions, and gain a better understanding of the world around them. This can lead to increased empathy and a more open-minded approach to life.\\n\\nFinally, the arts can have a positive impact on society as a whole. The arts can bring people together, foster a sense of community, and promote social and political change. By requiring an arts class for all students, we can ensure that future generations are equipped with the skills and knowledge they need to make a positive impact on the world.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe that requiring an arts class for all students is the better option.

       " \"Sure, I'd be happy to write an essay about one of my skills or talents!\\n\\nOne skill that I'm really passionate about is playing the guitar. I've been playing for about three years now, and it's become a big part of my life. I love how it allows me to express myself and relieve stress. Whenever I'm feeling down, I can pick up my guitar and start playing, and it always makes me feel better.\\n\\nDeveloping my guitar skills has been a process. At first, it was really hard to press down on the strings and make the right chords. My fingers were sore and my hands would cramp up, but I didn't give up. I practiced every day, even if it was just for a few minutes. As time went on, I started to get better, and I could play more complex songs. Now, I can play my favorite songs and even write my own music.\\n\\nPlaying the guitar has also helped me in other areas of my life. For example, it's taught me patience and perseverance. When I first started playing, I was frustrated because I couldn't get it right away. But, I kept practicing and eventually, I started to see progress. This has helped me in other areas of my life, like schoolwork and sports. Whenever I'm struggling with something, I remind myself of how I learned to play the guitar, and it gives me the motivation to keep going.\\n\\nAnother way that playing the guitar has impacted my life is by providing an outlet for self-expression. Whenever I'm feeling emotional or want to express something, I can pick up my guitar and play. It's like my own personal therapy session. I can play songs that reflect how I'm feeling, and it helps me process my emotions. It's also a way for me to connect with others, whether it's through playing at school events or sharing my music with friends and family.\\n\\nOverall, playing the guitar has become a big part of my life. It's taught me valuable skills like patience and perseverance, and it provides an outlet for self-expression. I'm grateful that I discovered this talent, and I can't wait to see where it takes\",\n",
       " \" I disagree with the school board's decision to increase the amount of time students spend in school. While I understand the importance of education, I believe that students need to have their own time outside of school to spend with their families and friends.\\n\\nFurthermore, I believe that students should have a say in this decision. The school board should consider the opinions of students and take them into account when making decisions that affect their lives. This could be done by conducting a survey or focus group to gather feedback from students about their thoughts on the proposed changes.\\n\\nIn addition, I think that the school board should consider the potential negative impact of keeping students in school for longer hours. For example, students may experience burnout or fatigue, which could lead to decreased academic performance. It is important for the school board to weigh the benefits of increased school time against the potential negative consequences.\\n\\nOverall, I believe that the school board should take a more holistic approach to education and consider the needs and opinions of students when making decisions that affect their lives. By doing so, they can ensure that students are receiving the best possible education while also taking into account their overall well-being.\",\n",
       " ' The act of accomplishing something is a testament to our dedication and perseverance. As the 3rd President of the U.S.A once said, \"Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.\" This quote emphasizes the importance of being constantly active and striving towards our goals.\\n\\nMany people believe that setting a goal is the first step towards accomplishing something. However, it\\'s important to note that not all goals are created equal. Some people set easy goals that they can accomplish with little effort, while others set challenging goals that require hard work and determination. For example, my sister sets goals that are simple enough for her to accomplish, but my brother sets goals that are much more difficult and require a great deal of effort.\\n\\nFor those who don\\'t like setting goals, they may still find ways to accomplish something. Whether it\\'s through trial and error or by taking calculated risks, there are always opportunities to achieve success.\\n\\nOne of the most important aspects of accomplishing something is trying your best. When we put in our best effort, we are more likely to succeed. For example, my brother accomplished something by trying his best at his final exam. However, many people don\\'t even try their best to accomplish something. They may give up too easily or become discouraged by obstacles along the way.\\n\\nFinally, showing what we have accomplished can be a powerful way to inspire others. When we share our successes, we can motivate others to pursue their own goals and work towards achieving them. For example, Luke showed everyone what he had accomplished by getting his mile run decreasing. While some may have thought this was a show-off, it was ultimately a testament to Luke\\'s hard work and dedication.\\n\\nIn conclusion, accomplishing something is a wonderful thing that requires dedication, perseverance, and hard work. Whether it\\'s through setting goals, trying our best, or showing what we have accomplished, there are always opportunities to achieve success.',\n",

       " ' The quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson, \"To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else the greatest accomplishment,\" is a powerful statement that highlights the importance of self-expression and authenticity. However, this quote is often misinterpreted, and people believe that being someone else is the greatest accomplishment. In this essay, I will argue that being yourself is the greatest accomplishment and that people should strive to achieve their goals without trying to be someone else.\\n\\nFirstly, people often believe that achieving their goals is the greatest accomplishment. However, this is not always the case. If the world wants you to do something, it is not always the right thing for you to do. People need to achieve their goals without someone telling them what to do in their life. They have to know if their goals are right for them to achieve. People with goals often don\\'t like their goals because the world wants them to be something else in their lives. They may mistakenly want to be someone else rather than what they don\\'t want to do.\\n\\nSecondly, people who are not achieving their goals often try to be someone else because they don\\'t have a goal or they are not themselves. People are trying to be someone else in their lives by being not themselves. However, this is not a true accomplishment. People have tried being themselves but failed because they cannot find themselves. The majority of people will be something else rather than being who they are inside of them. The world is a big place to be in, and people don\\'t want to express themselves out in the world, so they try to be someone else to fit in.\\n\\nThirdly, the majority of people who are not being themselves are not happy with their decision because they are trying to hide their real self. People are not showing who they are out in the world. Often times, people don\\'t like to see themselves because they haven\\'t found themselves. People are most likely to go out and be something than to follow their goals.\\n\\nIn conclusion, being yourself is the greatest accomplishment. People don\\'t have to be someone else as a greatest accomplishment. People are not being themselves in the world. They hide it to become someone else in the world. This quote is not true because people are not achieving their goals, they are trying to be someone else, and they are not being about themselves',\n",
       " 'Success and failure are essential parts of the human experience, but how we confront them can completely change the values that we take away from each. Famous personalities such as Walt Disney, Steve Jobs, and J.K. Rowling all encountered failure before rising to greatness. By analyzing their approaches to failure, we can uncover which behaviors and attitudes can help turn a stumble into a success. \\n\\nWalt Disney was fired from his first newspaper job due to “lacking creativity”, but refused to allow this setback to deter him. Instead, he used the experience to both identify his strengths and passions and to grow as a creative thinker and entrepreneur. Steve Jobs, too, experienced numerous rejections when first launching his business, but was able to reframe his disappointed into determination and achieve major success. \\n\\nJ.K. Rowling struggled with extreme poverty and depression before “Harry Potter” was released. Her story speaks to the power of hope and enthusiasm, as she was able to remain resistant to defeat and keep pushing forward. These real life examples show us that a positive outlook can be an extremely valuable tool when overcoming failure. \\n\\nFailure can be a great opportunity to learn more about ourselves and our capabilities. It can give us a greater appreciation for success, reveal our strengths and weaknesses, and offer valuable lessons \\xadfor the future. Thus, developing strong self-awareness and keeping a positive attitude can help individuals cope with disappointing setbacks and lead them to brighter opportunities. \\n\\nThis essay has discussed how some of the most successful individuals in history have made use of failure. It has discussed how Walt Disney, Steve Jobs, and J.K. Rowling have used resiliency and positive thinking to soar beyond their setbacks and pointed to the importance of developing self-awareness and remaining hopeful in the face of difficulty. In doing so, it has illustrated how failure can ultimately assist in achieving triumphant success.',\n",
       " ' When did you decide to pursue your dream career?\\n\\nIt\\'s important for individuals to have a clear idea of what they want to achieve in their professional life by the time they reach high school. By the time students reach high school, they should have a career path they\\'re passionate about. If students start exploring the concepts they need, they can become what they want to be. Also, by starting early with a goal, researching, and acknowledging goals, they can find a job that they\\'re excited about and have a distinct idea of how to succeed.\\n\\nThe first step in pursuing your dream career is to research different options available. In most societies, students start researching different jobs at a young age, so they know what they want to become in the future. Research helps students find what they need as a teenager, for example: getting a Standard or Advanced diploma, going to College, and getting a degree. When students start encountering what they need to accomplish, they will tend to work hard and start receiving the information they desire. Also, research gives a better understanding for the student to know what to find. Although some may say \"Information online may be false\" but there are multiple sites you can examine to observe the true facts.\\n\\nThe second reason is that goals help individuals with finding a career to start. Goals help by giving an idea to an individual of what the next step is, to find the best career for them. Goals can be both limited and unlimited. Although some may say \"Individuals should start thinking after they graduate high school because there\\'s many jobs in life individuals might pick the wrong job\", but starting young helps the individual\\'s mind to find different careers. Also, individuals can decide what they would want to commit to.\\n\\nThe third reason is that acknowledging your goal will take a very important role in an individual\\'s life. If individuals complete their goals and research, they can acknowledge their goal. Examine the work they have finished and look through to check if they are missing anything. After individuals have finished their steps, they may continue on finding a job that they want from the data they collected. Finally, acknowledging goals will help in examining job duties.\\n\\nIn conclusion, individuals should start pursuing their dream career early. Starting young will help each individual with finding a job, how to determine if the job is right for you, and',\n",
       " \" I believe that students should not be allowed to use their cell phones in the classroom, as the potential benefits of doing so do not outweigh the distractions it could cause. With the increasing availability of laptops and tablets in schools, there are now numerous online resources available to students for educational purposes. These resources, combined with the school's own educational materials, provide students with a wealth of information and tools to help them succeed in their studies.\\n\\nMoreover, the use of cell phones in the classroom can be highly distracting to both the students and the teacher. For example, students may be tempted to use their phones to browse social media or play games instead of focusing on their classwork. This can lead to a decrease in productivity and a loss of valuable class time. Additionally, teachers may find it difficult to monitor their students' progress and provide assistance when needed if they are constantly distracted by the use of cell phones.\\n\\nFurthermore, many schools have libraries filled with educational resources that students can use to supplement their studies. These resources, such as books and journals, can provide students with a more focused and structured approach to learning, as opposed to the more unstructured and potentially distracting nature of using a cell phone.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while there may be some benefits to using cell phones in the classroom, such as the ability to contact family members, the potential distractions and decreased productivity make it a less useful tool for students. By respecting the time of both students and teachers, we can create a more focused and productive learning environment.\",\n",

If the principle then puts community service they might not be able to do it and it could become stressful for somebody who already has a busy life.\\n\\nAlso it could be a good idea because there are a lot of lazy people who don't really get outside to much and the community service could be good for them.

       " ' As a species, we have been able to survive and thrive for as long as we have because we have learned the importance of cooperation and division of labor. From the earliest days, we have recognized that two heads are better than one and that there are certain tasks that are best left to others. We have come a long way since then, building intricate structures and crossing vast oceans in a matter of minutes. However, I cannot help but wonder if an individual could have achieved such feats on their own. That is why teamwork is crucial.\\n\\nWhen working in a team, each individual brings a unique skill or ability to the table. For example, if you work for a company that specializes in creating websites for government projects, you may possess a degree in coding and graphic design. As a content creator, you can see yourself as a cog in a larger machine, meticulously fitting into the overall structure. One that operates at a constant pace, without deviating or putting too much pressure on any one part.\\n\\nSecondly, when working in a team, the workload is divided in a way that ensures everyone is able to handle their portion. In a construction crew, the cement worker will always divide the cement into smaller portions, to prevent overuse and ensure that the work is evenly distributed. Similarly, in a kitchen, one person may be peeling the carrots, another preparing the cake mix, and another the toppings. Each person has a specific task to complete.\\n\\nIn conclusion, teamwork has numerous benefits for individuals and society as a whole. Like a well-oiled machine, teamwork is all about communication and cooperation. When everyone knows their role and works together, the result is a seamless and efficient operation. Remember, there will always be tasks that are beyond our individual capabilities. Teamwork is the most important lesson we will ever learn.',\n",

One effective method is to encourage students to engage in activities that challenge them and help them develop new skills. This can include participating in sports, clubs, or other extracurricular activities. Additionally, providing students with opportunities to take on leadership roles and make decisions can also help build self-esteem. Finally, it is important to create a supportive and positive environment in the classroom, where students feel valued and respected by their teachers and peers.\\n\\nHaving good self-esteem has numerous benefits for students. For one, it can lead to improved academic performance, as students are more likely to believe in their abilities and take on challenges. Additionally, good self-esteem can help students develop healthy relationships with others, as they are more likely to trust and respect themselves. Furthermore, students with high self-esteem are more likely to have positive mental health and well-being, as they are less likely to experience anxiety and depression.\\n\\nAs a student, it is essential to believe in yourself and your abilities. This means taking risks and stepping out of your comfort zone, even when it may be scary or challenging. Believing in yourself can help you overcome obstacles and achieve your goals, as you are more likely to have the confidence and motivation to keep going. Furthermore, believing in yourself can help you develop a growth mindset, where you view challenges as opportunities for learning and growth, rather than as threats to your self-worth.\\n\\nWhen it comes to building self-esteem, it is important to focus on effort rather than results. While it is important to strive for excellence and achieve your goals, it is equally important to recognize and celebrate your progress and accomplishments, no matter how',\n",

In most situations its by choice since its helping the student. Many students take classes at home due to issues such as anxiety problems, being disabled, or as a way to counter bullying.\\n\\nAnxiety is a mental disorder that is commonly diagnosed to people in the United States. Some have it worse than others; so much worse to the point where people have trouble being in an environment surrounded by others. That's why for some students taking classes from home is much more effective since they can actually concentrate. Anxiety isn't the only mental disorder where online school is needed; theres people who have seizures or have triggers that cause them not be around\\xa0others. Theres also people who are disabled and have trouble moving around; so for them being able to stay in the same place and take different classes is very beneficial to them.\\n\\nBullying is another reason students would take classes from school. Sometimes peers make it so hard to learn due to harassment or bullying. Home is a place where many would call it safe space. Finally students are able to attend class and learn; instead of constantly worrying about being hurt or made fun of. This a very effective counter for kids who are constantly being bullied. This way they are able to learn in peace.\\n\\nSome say that students are going to have a harder time learning from home due to all the distractions. While yes that does makes sense, but if a student actually wants to learn and is dedicated to it. Then they will succeed no matter where they're taking their classes. Taking classes at home isn't that much different than being home schooled.\\n\\nFor many students being able to take classes at home is a very useful resource.

But honestly, it's so important to keep pushing through and not give up.\\n\\nFirst of all, when we give up, we're basically telling ourselves that we're not good enough. And that's just not true. I mean, think about it. Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and just because we might not be as good at something as someone else doesn't mean we're not good at anything.

And those are like, super important qualities to have. Like, think about it. If we give up on something we really want, like a sports team or a project, we're basically saying that we're not willing to put in the effort to achieve our goals. And that's not cool. But if we keep trying, even when it's hard, we're showing ourselves and everyone else that we're willing to put in the work to achieve our dreams.\\n\\nAnd finally, when we don't give up, we're more likely to succeed.

But if we keep pushing through, even when it's hard, we're more likely to achieve our goals. And that's like, the best feeling in the world.\\n\\nSo, in conclusion, giving up is not the answer. If we keep trying, we're showing ourselves and everyone else that we're persistent and determined, and we're more likely to succeed. So, let's all try our best and not give up, okay?

       " \"Hey there!  So, I was like, totally assigned to write this essay about how spending time together and doing stuff we both like can help relationships grow and stuff. Like, duh, right? But I guess it's important to actually think about it and stuff.\\n\\nSo, like, when we spend time with people and do things we both enjoy, it's like, super good for our relationships. It's like, builds trust and stuff, and makes us feel closer to each other. Like, when my BFF and I go to the mall together and shop for new clothes, it's like, way more fun than if we were just hanging out at my house. And we get to pick out stuff we both like, so it's like, a win-win.\\n\\nBut, like, sometimes people's perceptions and attitudes can change over time. Like, my little brother used to think he hated soccer, but then he started playing on a team and now he's like, totally into it. So, it's important to ask how someone is feeling when we first meet them, because they might not always feel the same way.\\n\\nAnd, like, it's important to spend time with people and do things we both enjoy, because it's good for our relationships and stuff. Like, my parents are always trying to get me to do stuff with them, like go for a hike or watch a movie together, and it's actually pretty fun.

       " \"As the end of a school year comes to a close, the summer is just beginning. Many during summer use it as a time to have fun and take a break from school. Some schools though require students to complete a summer project to ensure learning continues throughout the year. This can help to make sure that the student mind is awake and ready to learn when the start of the new school year begins. The basis for summer projects to assure continuous learning should be student-designed because creative projects would be produced and it would give students an opportunity to take control of their education.\\n\\nDuring the school year, students go from class to class completing the required work to excel. In most cases, this requires sitting through a lecture followed by an activity and homework. All of which are teacher-designed. For this reason, summer projects should be student-designed. Student-designed projects would give students the opportunity to take control of their education. Students would learn the responsibility of completing a project without a teacher telling them the process they should follow. The students would have to research and create a project based on something that they are passionate about. For example, every student has their own interest such as baking, rocketry, and architecture. With student-designed summer projects, each student can complete their own individualized project based on their own interests. As to where a teacher-designed project the student has to go with what the teacher assigns. If the teacher is interested in types of frogs, students would have to complete a project based on the interest of the teacher. Student-designed summer projects would give students the opportunity to take control of their education.\\n\\nWhen a teacher assigns a project, there are strict guidelines on how the project should be completed. To combat the harsh guidelines, a student-designed project would create more creative projects. For example, if there are 20 students in a class with one teacher and the teacher assigns a project, there will be 20 of the same project that return because of the guidelines that the teacher established when creating the project. But if every one of the 20 students got to design their own project, there will be 20 different projects that come back to be presented. This will happen because the students will feel more personally connected to their project. Students won't feel as if it is a project the teachers gave them but rather something fun to do over the summer. Having a summer project that is designed by an individual, the teacher, for a group, the students, will create a detriment\\xa0to creativity.\\n\\nSome may argue that if summer projects were teacher-designed, then the teachers could regulate and prepare the students better for the upcoming school year. This may be true, but considering that throughout the normal school year teachers design and assign work to students, it would be more beneficial to give students the opportunity to learn how to take charge of their own work. Continuing to have teachers dictate the types of projects students complete year round will not prepare them for the world.\\xa0A student-designed project would prepare students better for the world. Once the students enter the world, there won't always be a teacher telling them how to complete the task assigned to them. Giving students the opportunity to experience independence over the summer is a perfect way to prepare them for the world. Preparing students for the world out of school is more important than preparing them for a few weeks in the future when school starts.\\n\\nSchools that require students to complete a summer project should make the projects student-designed. Student-designed projects would cause for more creative projects compared to teacher-designed projects, and it would give students the opportunity to take charge of their education. Having summer projects to insure students continuous learning is a terrific way to enhance a students education. But done incorrectly, it can cause a student to dread school more. A well executed summer project would be student-designed, where the student gets to decide on their own project based on an interest of their liking. Making sure that students are positively active in their education is crucial to developing a well rounded individual.\",\n",
       " ' I believe that setting our aim too low will ultimately help us achieve our goals, as it allows us to learn from our mistakes and work hard to improve ourselves. In many cases, people who set their aim too high often fail to achieve their goals, while those who set their aim too low may not even try. However, those who set their aim too low are more likely to learn from their mistakes and work hard to improve themselves.\\n\\nFor example, when I failed my math class last year, I realized that I needed to work harder and understand the material better. I started studying more at home and asking my teacher questions after school. While it was difficult at first, I eventually understood the material and passed the class. This experience taught me the importance of working hard and never giving up on my goals.\\n\\nAdditionally, setting our aim too low can also help us achieve our goals by allowing us to focus on the process rather than the outcome. When we set our aim too high, we may become too focused on the end result and lose sight of the steps we need to take to achieve it. On the other hand, when we set our aim too low, we can focus on the process and make small, incremental improvements. This can lead to a greater sense of accomplishment and motivation to continue working towards our goals.\\n\\nFurthermore, setting our aim too low can also help us learn from the experiences of others who have achieved their goals. By learning from the mistakes and successes of others, we can gain valuable insights and strategies that can help us achieve our own goals. This can be especially helpful for those who are new to a particular field or industry.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe that setting our aim too low can ultimately help us achieve our goals by allowing us to learn from our mistakes, focus on the process, and learn from the experiences of others. While it may not be the most popular or easy approach, it can lead to greater success and fulfillment in the long run.',\n",
       " \"The electoral college has many inherint flaws that make it less desirable than a simple election by popular vote. It's only rebuttals to said flaws are weak, and provide little to no reason why the college is beneficial. So there is no real reason to have it in the first place. Popular vote stands to not only correct the errors of the electoral college, but also to refine our voting system. It would accomplish this by closer to a real democracy, and forcing the candidates to win over more people.\\n\\nA democracy has long been revered as one of the best forms of government. It is more liberating than a dictatorship or monarchy in which people are governed by a higher class, which is more often than not decided by someone other than themselves. In a democracy however, people are given the ability to put who they desire in office. They have the ability to be governed by the person of their choice. This, however, is impeded upon by the electoral college. Because what it does is simply insert a middle man into an otherwise democratic society. We are forced to rely on people we elect to vote for us. Which is irrational as it is completely unecessary. The extra step only sets us up for deception and betrayal. I mean why would you trust a man on the street to cast a vote for you when doing so yourself is much more reliable?\\n\\nThough why does it even matter if the candidate you want to vote for won't even come to your state? There's obviously no reason to vote democrat if your say will simply be overshadowed by the wave of republicans in your area. With popular vote though, candidates should be more inclined to visit as many states as possible and get their message out there. Because a 51% vote in a state no longer means a 100% victory. With the new influx of political campaigns, perhaps more people are swayed from their usual path of voting. While yes, there are neutral states that need a push either way, you're not going to increase your votes ten-fold by pushing past that 50% barrier. You actually have to earn every vote you get.\\n\\nThere is no real reason to keep the electoral college. It serves as a pointless middle man to an otherwise great government. Popular vote requires more out of the candidates, and puts more say into the individual vote.\\xa0    \",\n",
       " 'As the years go by there had seemed to be more and more polution in the world. Most of that polution had been seen to be produced by cars, which some people wouldn\\'t know how to live without. However, studies have shown that some cities around the world have actually decreased the usage of cars. A city that has virtually no cars would be Vauban, Germany, and other cities such as Paris, France, Bogota, Colombia, and even some in the United States have joined in the decreasing of car use wagan. In turn of not using cars as much the polution has gone down in those cities.\\n\\nTo begin with, Vauban, Germany, in this German city \" Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban\\'s streets are completely \\'car-free\\'-- except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park -- large garages at the edge of the development,where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.\"( P2, In German Suburn, Life Goes On Without Cars, Elisabeth Rosenthal) And in Paris, \" After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters ...

It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violaters faced $25 fines.

Also, now even the United States is using less cars, \" America\\'s love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an invesment research comany.

       " \"Zoos have been a controversial topic for a long time, with people arguing both for and against their continued operation. While some people believe that zoos play a crucial role in conservation and education, others argue that they are unethical and serve no purpose. In my opinion, zoos are necessary for the conservation of endangered species and for educating the public about wildlife.\\n\\nFirstly, zoos are an important tool in the conservation of endangered species. They provide a safe environment for animals to breed and raise their young, away from the threats of habitat loss, poaching, and climate change. For example, the giant panda is an endangered species that has been successfully bred in zoos and released back into the wild. Without zoos, it is likely that this species would have become extinct. Additionally, zoos also play a role in the rehabilitation of injured animals, providing them with a safe place to recover and eventually return to their natural habitats.\\n\\nSecondly, zoos serve as an important educational tool. They provide people with an opportunity to see and learn about animals that they may not have seen before. This can inspire people, especially children, to develop an interest in wildlife and conservation. Zoos also offer educational programs and activities that teach people about the importance of conservation and how they can help protect wildlife. For example, many zoos have programs that teach children about the impact of human activities on the environment and how they can reduce their carbon footprint.\\n\\nFurthermore, zoos also play a role in research and scientific advancements. They provide scientists with access to animals that they can study and learn from, which can lead to new discoveries and advancements in the field of wildlife conservation. For example, researchers have studied the behavior of animals in zoos to better understand their social structures and habitat needs, which can help inform conservation efforts.\\n\\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that there are also valid arguments against the continued operation of zoos. Some people argue that zoos are unethical because they keep animals in captivity, away from their natural habitats. This can be detrimental to the animals' mental and physical health, as they are not able to roam freely and engage in natural behaviors. Additionally, some zoos have been criticized for their living conditions, with animals being kept in small enclosures with little room to move around.\\n\\nTo address these concerns, it is important for zoos to prioritize the welfare of the animals in their care. They should provide animals with large, naturalistic enclosures that mimic their natural habitats, and ensure that they have access to mental stimulation and exercise. Additionally, zoos should also prioritize conservation efforts and work to release animals back into the wild whenever possible.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while there are valid arguments against the continued operation of zoos, I believe that they play a crucial role in conservation and education. By providing a safe environment for animals to breed and raise their young, serving as an educational tool, and contributing to research and scientific advancements, zoos are an important part of our efforts to protect wildlife. However, it is important for zoos to prioritize the welfare of the animals in their care and work towards releasing them back into the wild whenever possible.\",\n",

       " 'Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nLimiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. This is evident in the examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, where innovative approaches to transportation have had positive effects. By reducing car dependency, these communities have managed to improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, and promote alternative modes of transportation.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact on the environment. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, cars account for 12 percent of these emissions, and in car-intensive areas in the United States, they contribute up to 50 percent. By reducing the number of cars on the road, as seen in Vauban and during the car-free day in Bogota, these communities are effectively reducing their carbon footprint and helping to combat climate change.\\n\\nAdditionally, limiting car usage can help alleviate traffic congestion. In Vauban, where car ownership is allowed but parking is restricted, 70 percent of families do not own cars. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, the streets in Vauban are quiet and free of traffic. This not only improves the quality of life for residents but also reduces the time wasted in traffic and the stress associated with driving.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of healthier and more active lifestyles. Vauban, for example, has prioritized walking and biking by placing stores within walking distance and creating extensive bicycle paths. This encourages residents to engage in physical activity and leads to numerous health benefits. Similarly, during the car-free day in Bogota, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work, promoting physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior.\\n\\nFinally, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passage mentions that delivery companies in Paris complained of lost revenue during the driving ban due to smog. However, this can be seen as an opportunity for alternative modes of transportation, such as bike and pedestrian couriers, to thrive. By diversifying the transportation industry and reducing dependence on cars, there is potential for job creation and economic growth.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals and the environment. It improves air quality, reduces traffic congestion, promotes active lifestyles, and can have economic benefits. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the positive impacts of limiting car usage and provide inspiration for other communities to adopt similar practices. As the world continues to grapple with the challenges of climate change and urbanization, reevaluating our car dependency and embracing alternative modes of transportation is crucial.',\n",

       " 'Working alone or in a group has been a topic of debate for many years. Some people argue that working alone is more beneficial than working with a group, while others argue that working with a group is more beneficial. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages of both working alone and working with a group, and provide my own opinion on why working alone is more beneficial.\\n\\nWorking alone has many advantages. Firstly, it allows for more focus and concentration. When working alone, there are fewer distractions and interruptions, allowing you to fully concentrate on the task at hand. This can lead to increased productivity and efficiency. Secondly, working alone allows for more creativity and individuality. When working with a group, there may be limitations on what can be achieved due to groupthink and conformity. Working alone allows for more experimentation and exploration of different ideas without fear of criticism or judgment. Finally, working alone can be more cost-effective. When working with a group, there are often additional expenses such as renting a meeting space or purchasing materials. Working alone eliminates these expenses and can save money.\\n\\nOn the other hand, working with a group also has its advantages. Firstly, working with a group can lead to more collaboration and teamwork. When working with a group, there are multiple perspectives and ideas that can be combined to achieve a common goal. This can lead to more creative solutions and a better understanding of the task at hand. Secondly, working with a group can provide emotional support and motivation. When working with a group, there are people to share ideas with and receive feedback from. This can provide emotional support and motivation to continue working towards the goal. Finally, working with a group can provide a sense of community and belonging. When working with a group, there is a shared sense of purpose and identity, which can provide a sense of community and belonging.\\n\\nIn my opinion, working alone is more beneficial than working with a group. While working with a group can provide emotional support and a sense of community, it can also lead to groupthink and conformity, which can limit creativity and individuality. Working alone allows for more focus and concentration, creativity, and individuality, which can lead to increased productivity and efficiency. Additionally, working alone can be more cost-effective, which is an important consideration for many people.\\n\\nIn conclusion, both working alone and working with a group have their advantages.',\n",

       " ' Dear Principal,\\n\\nI believe that students should not be allowed to bring their cell phones to school as they are a major distraction and contribute to low grades. According to a recent study, 10% of students are failing because of the constant use of their cell phones.

Therefore, I strongly recommend that cell phones be banned in school to help students improve their grades and academic performance.',\n",
       " \"The face on Mars is 100% just a natural formation of rocks and sand/dust. Pictures show this, everytime NASA does take a picture of it there are the same results. Plus if it was alien why would NASA publish the pictures. If this was proof of aliens it would put people into freak out mode.\\n\\nThe first thing is that giant rock formations aren't uncommon in the cydonia section of Mars. In fact there are a whole bunch of different kinds of rocks just like the face, only that those are normal looking. They don't look like faces. The article even says that the picture actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. Even Garvin says ''It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,'' then he keeps going to say ''That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.''\\n\\nThe second thing is close up images. Over the years NASA has been taking pictures of this formation. Each time they take a picture of face, the face starts to look more and more like a rock formation. NASA even publicly posted pictures on the web, and all diferent kinds of media to show what the formation looks like. So, NASA must of been pretty confident in what they were saying the picture was. Plus NASA is made of the top of the line professionlas. They aren't made up of people who dropped out of highschool. They are made up of people who have graduated from some of the most advanced and instutionalized colleges.\\n\\nMy third thing is if it was alien, why would NASA publicly show the pictures. In the article, it makes NASA look like they were trying to get people to get away from the alien idea. By the sound of it, I would take a guess and say if it was alien, NASA would do everything in their power to keep the images from getting out into the public. Another thing is that at one point people were saying that the picture taken on April 5, 1998, was not liable because of the fact that 98 was a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. So, NASA on April 8, 2001, took another photo in the year 2001 and 2001 was not a cloudy year for the Red Planet .The photo even further backed up the fact that the formation on Mars is just another giant rock, not some alien face or artifact.\\n\\nSo in the end why would this be an alien face or aritfact. NASA has publicly proven that it is just a formation of rocks and dust/sand. Plus if NASA didn't wan't us to know about aliens or anything of the sort, why would they publicly anounce and show pictures of the Face of Mars. That is why the Face of Mars is not related to anything alien at all and is just another formation in the cydonia sector of Mars.  \",\n",
       " 'Dear Professor,\\n\\nI am writing to argue for the need to change the school menu in order to improve student health and academic performance. While some may argue that the current menu is sufficient, I believe that there are several reasons why it should be changed.\\n\\nFirstly, the current school menu often lacks nutritious options. Many students are forced to choose between unhealthy options such as pizza and fries, or go hungry. This is not only unhealthy, but it can also negatively impact academic performance. Studies have shown that students who eat a healthy diet are more likely to perform better academically.\\n\\nSecondly, the school menu can be expensive. Many students come from low-income families and cannot afford to pay for the more expensive options. This can lead to students going hungry or choosing less healthy options. By offering more affordable options, we can ensure that all students have access to nutritious meals.\\n\\nFinally, the school menu can be monotonous. Many students get bored with the same options day in and day out. This can lead to students skipping meals or choosing unhealthy options. By offering a wider variety of options, we can ensure that students are more likely to eat a healthy and balanced diet.\\n\\nIn conclusion, changing the school menu is crucial for the health and academic performance of students. By offering more nutritious, affordable, and varied options, we can ensure that all students have access to the food they need to succeed.\\n\\nFor example, at my school, we have recently implemented a new menu that includes more healthy options such as salads and whole grains. This has been well received by students and has led to a decrease in the number of students skipping meals. Additionally, many schools have implemented \"lunch and learn\" programs where students can learn about nutrition and healthy eating while enjoying their lunch.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that changing the school menu is necessary for the health and academic performance of students. By offering more nutritious, affordable, and varied options, we can ensure that all students have access to the food they need to succeed.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]',\n",
       " \"Dear principal.\\n\\nI have read your two possible policies. Policy one is a good policy the reason why is because know a days all students have a phone. It would be better for you just to let them have a phone because if you don't students will go in their own risk of consequences just to have their phone in handy. If you could notice, also know a days all students really care about is having their phone. That is a really special object to any teenager, your students from your school will really appreciate it if you allow them to use their phone during free time or lunch periods. I can ensure you that is you let this policy go students gradually will love you, and knowing that they can use their phone in those free minutes they will not have the need to use it during the class time. I would have to choose policy one as the most reasonable and it would be fair for both you as the principal and the students of your school.\\n\\nPolicy two will cause the students to rebel against the school just for not letting them bring a phone to school. As you know by now students will go to the extremes for one little thing. Not allowing to bring phones to school might be a trouble of some students. The reason why is because they use their phone to communicate with their parents or family members. If parents don't have a way to call their children after school to get picked up, or if something bad has happened would lead up to using the school phone just to ask any parents for a little question. It would be better just to let them have a phone so that this situation would not happen.\\n\\nMy main reasons to agree with policy one is that with that policy students at your school will have more respect for you just so you would let them use their phone at school. If this policy passes i think students will probably come down a little bit and they will actually like the school even more. They would tell their family and friends of the school soon a large amount of people would want to sign up in your school. These are the reason why i agree with policy one.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME\",\n",
       " 'The use of cellphones in the classroom has been a topic of debate for many years. While some people argue that cellphones can be useful tools for learning, others believe that they are a major distraction and can lead to cheating and inappropriate behavior. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons why using cellphones in the classroom is discouraged and offer suggestions on how to use them responsibly to benefit learning.\\n\\nOne of the main reasons why using cellphones in the classroom is discouraged is because of the potential for distractions. Cellphones are designed to be engaging and entertaining, and it can be difficult for students to resist the temptation to check their messages, play games, or scroll through social media while they are supposed to be paying attention to the teacher. This can lead to a lack of focus on the lesson and can make it difficult for students to learn new concepts.\\n\\nAnother reason why using cellphones in the classroom is discouraged is because of the potential for cheating. With the internet at their fingertips, students can easily access answers to questions or cheat on tests and assignments. This not only undermines the value of education, but it also makes it difficult for teachers to assess the true knowledge and understanding of their students.\\n\\nIn addition to these practical concerns, there are also potential negative consequences of using cellphones that can occur both in and out of the classroom. For example, students may engage in inappropriate comments or behaviors while using their cellphones, which can lead to bullying or other negative outcomes. This can create a hostile and unsafe learning environment for all students.\\n\\nDespite these concerns, there are ways that students can use cellphones responsibly in the classroom to benefit learning. For example, cellphones can be used as a tool for research and collaboration. Students can use their cellphones to access information and share ideas with their classmates. This can help to enhance their learning and promote critical thinking and problem-solving skills.\\n\\nAnother way that cellphones can be used responsibly in the classroom is by setting boundaries and limiting their use during class. For example, students can agree to turn off their cellphones during class and only use them for educational purposes. This can help to minimize distractions and promote a more focused learning environment.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while there are valid reasons why using cellphones in the classroom is discouraged, there are also ways',\n",
       " \"Dear Principal,\\n\\nI think that every student should have to do community service for picking up trash and also cleaning up the school. Every student should have to do community service because some of those students are the ones that are making the mess at school. But it is also an unfair decision because some of the students that have to be required to do community service aren't the ones usually making all of that trash so it would be wasting their time, some of the students could just be innocent. Although if you would like a clean school you might want to consider requiring community service for at least every classroom to take turns doing community service.\\n\\nThose students that tend to litter at school should be the ones cleaning up after themselves. For example some students just throw their trash on the ground without even caring that it could destroy their school. Having community service is very important because the whole entire school could just build up the trash.\\n\\nTherefore, the idea of having community service is a great idea. Students should be required to have community service. The school would look much better without any rubbish on the ground.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME\",\n",
       " \"Hey, so like, I know some people might think it's weird to want to graduate high school early, but hear me out. I think it's actually really beneficial for high school students to potentially graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years.\\n\\nFirst of all, let's talk about career goals. If I can graduate a year earlier, I'll have more time to focus on my future career. I want to be a game developer, and that takes time and dedication. By graduating early, I can start working on my portfolio and building my skills even before I enter college. Plus, I'll have more time to intern or volunteer in the field, which will give me a huge advantage when it comes to getting hired after graduation.\\n\\nAnother thing to consider is family. I come from a big family, and my parents are always stressing about money. Graduating early means I'll be able to save money on tuition and living expenses, which will help my family out a lot. Plus, I'll be able to contribute to the family income earlier, which will be a huge relief for them.\\n\\nAnd let's not forget about financial freedom. Graduating early means I'll have more time to save money and pay off any debt I might accumulate during college. That's a huge burden off my shoulders, and it means I'll be able to start my adult life with less financial stress.\\n\\nNow, I know some people might say that graduating early means I'll miss out on important social experiences, like prom and senior trip. But honestly, I think those things are overrated. I'd rather have the freedom to travel and explore the world on my own terms than spend my time in high school doing things that don't really matter to me.\\n\\nOf course, there are some potential downsides to graduating early. I might miss out on some classes or opportunities that are only available to traditional students. And I'll have to be extra careful to make sure I'm ready for the academic challenges of college. But I think the benefits of graduating early far outweigh the drawbacks.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I think it's totally possible for high school students to graduate in three years instead of four.

       " \"I think that online schooling could be benficial to students. I think this because the student could take the course at the pace that they learn at and learning in a non-school enviroment could make it easier for the student to learn.\\n\\nLearning at a faster or too slow of a pace could mess with the students learning habits by forgetting, or not beig to learn all the material that they need to learn. Learning at your own pace is less stressful than going too fast. When learning too slowly, the student could possible forget material learned in the past. Doing online school allows the student to go at their own pace and take the test at their own speed without having to wait on others to know the material. When I am taking a test I mostly remeber the material that we recently learned, and it's harder to remember the things that have been taught two weeks before the test. Also, some material may come easily to the student while others can take more time to understand. When learning in a public school you may not be able to understand all that you may need to learn for that test.\\n\\nLearning from home could be very benificial to students that have trouble staying focused or students that get nervous in large groups or in a classroom enviroment. I have known students that go to my school that feel uncomfortable during class. These students tend to ask to go out in the hallways to finish assignments or to complete a test. Online schooling can allow the student to learn in the comfort of their home. Being at home could also mean less distractions while learning. Sometimes these distractions can lead to a headache. Having a headache during class can be very uncomfortable and that can make it a lot harder to learn and to pay attention. Distractions during school can mean not having time to finish an assignment or notes. Online school tends to take place at the students home and can allow the student to stay focused in a quite enviroment. Being in a quite enviroment can also make it more comfortable for the student to learn. Learning at home can be quite and there will most likely be no distractions in the area the student decides to study in. Being at home can be more comfortable for the students that don't feel comfortable in a school enviroment. Being comfortable can make the student less stressed out resulting in better grades in school or online schools.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I do think that online school can benefit students. Online school can allow the student to go at their own pace and oline school most likely takes place at home which can make the students feel more comfortable. Both of these reasons make it easier for the student to learn.\\xa0\",\n",

Some decisions require effort and hard work, such as studying to achieve a good grade or working hard to achieve a successful career. On the other hand, some decisions are easier, such as investing money or taking a shortcut to achieve a goal. However, not everyone has the same opportunities or resources to make these decisions, and their choices may be limited by their current financial situation or other factors.\\n\\nFor example, someone with a lot of money may have the option to make decisions quickly and easily, without worrying about financial constraints.

Though, they have also caused trouble in several ways as well. One of said ways is the severe amount of people who are distracted by them while driving.\\n\\nAs phones innovate more and more overtime, so does the amount of people who use them. Phones themselves are not a bad thing, the problem is how people often use them. There are a lot of people who will make text and calls, or even watch videos on their phone while they are driving. Doing this pulls the focus away from driving and causes danger for those who are distracted, and their fellow drivers on the road.

Yes, i do, but did anyone see cruise control being a thing when it was first invented, i dont think so. Some major issues i see is law suits, and such when they are invloved in a accicent, such as who fault it is the driver or the computer, and what you can do if it is the computers fault. what if it kills someone? who gets blammed, and who goes to jail for the crime.

       " 'Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nLimiting car usage has become a growing trend in many parts of the world. This concept, referred to as \"smart planning,\" aims to separate suburban life from auto use in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote alternative transportation options. There are several advantages of limiting car usage that are evident in the passage set.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the New York Times, passenger cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas in the United States. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly reduce these emissions and mitigate the harmful effects of climate change. In Vauban, Germany, a car-free community, 70 percent of families do not own cars, resulting in cleaner air and a more sustainable environment.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is improved public health. The use of cars is associated with sedentary behaviors, such as sitting for prolonged periods of time, which can lead to various health problems, including obesity and heart disease. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, or public transit, we can promote physical activity and improve overall health and well-being. In Bogota, Colombia, the implementation of a car-free day has led millions of people to hike, bike, skate, or use buses, resulting in empty streets and reduced traffic congestion.\\n\\nAdditionally, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible communities. In the traditional suburban model, cars are necessary for everyday activities, such as grocery shopping or commuting to work. However, by adopting a new approach that places stores within walking distance and emphasizes public transportation, we can create more vibrant and livable communities. Vauban, Germany, serves as an excellent example of this concept, with its walkable streets, bicycle-friendly infrastructure, and easy access to public transit.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The dependence on cars comes with significant costs, including fuel expenses, maintenance fees, and parking fees. By reducing car usage, individuals can save money and allocate those resources to other aspects of their lives. In Paris, France, a partial driving ban was enforced to combat smog and reduce pollution. While the ban resulted in some loss of revenue for delivery companies, it also highlighted the importance of sustainable transportation alternatives, such as plug-in cars and public transit.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage. This includes the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improved public health, the creation of more compact communities, and economic benefits. The passage set provides examples from different countries, such as Germany, France, and Colombia, where limiting car usage has led to positive outcomes. As we continue to prioritize sustainability and the well-being of our communities, limiting car usage should be considered as a viable solution. By implementing smart planning strategies and promoting alternative transportation options, we can create a more sustainable and livable future.',\n",

Seeking multiple opinions is a valuable tool that can improve communication skills, aid in decision-making, and guide others in the future. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of seeking multiple opinions and how it can positively influence one's life.\\n\\nFirstly, seeking multiple opinions can improve communication skills. When we seek out different perspectives, we are forced to listen actively and ask clarifying questions. This process helps us to better understand the people we are communicating with and develop empathy. By actively listening and understanding others, we can improve our communication skills and build stronger relationships.\\n\\nSecondly, gathering multiple opinions can help with decision-making. When faced with a decision, seeking out different perspectives can help us to consider all possible options and their implications. By hearing from people with different backgrounds and experiences, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the situation and make a more informed decision. This process can also help us to avoid making hasty decisions that may not be the best choice in the long run.\\n\\nThirdly, offering guidance and advice can guide others in the future. When we offer guidance and advice, we can help others to make informed decisions and improve their communication skills. By sharing our knowledge and experiences, we can empower others to take control of their lives and achieve their goals. This process can also help us to develop leadership skills and build stronger relationships with others.\\n\\nFinally, seeking multiple opinions can positively influence one's life. By seeking out different perspectives, we can broaden our horizons and gain a better understanding of the world around us. This process can help us to develop a more open-minded and accepting attitude, which can lead to greater personal growth and fulfillment. Additionally, by actively seeking out different perspectives, we can build stronger relationships with people from different backgrounds and experiences, which can lead to new opportunities and experiences.\\n\\nIn conclusion, seeking multiple opinions is a valuable tool that can improve communication skills, aid in decision-making, and guide others in the future. By actively seeking out different perspectives, we can develop empathy, leadership skills, and a more open-minded attitude. As an eighth-grade student, it is important to develop strong communication skills and seek out different perspectives to prepare for success in school, work\",\n",

It changes the way we choose how the elections work. Even though it avoids certain things and helps others it should not be changed.\\n\\nThe Electoral College makes the people basically choose one thing and then have the slate electors choose the president for them and that does not seem fair. In the source titled \"The Indefensible Electoral College:Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\", it said \" Under the electoral college system,\\xa0 voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" It seems unfair to have people waste their time voting for this and then to have something else make the decision.

Limiting car usage is a very effective way to eliminate stress, lower air pollution, reduce traffic, and save money to make the world a better and healthier place to live.\\n\\nTwo of the many advantages of limiting car usage is it eliminates stress and lowers air pollution. Being stressed is very unhealthy and a simple way to limit your stress is by limiting car usage. A media trainer named Heidrun Walter stated, \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way(Source 1).\" If having a car is stressful, then ride a bike, or take a bus that still takes you from point A to B, just like a car does. Car usage is bad for our planet when it comes to air polution. \"...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States(Source 1).\" Using other options besides taking a car would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Limiting car usage is a happier life and healthier living.\\n\\nSaving money and reducing traffic are other advantages of limiting car usage. Traffic is always a problem when trying to get where you need to go. \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world(Source 2).\" There\\'s always so many people rushing to get to work in the morning and your car only moves a couple feet per minute from all the backed up traffic but, if there wasn\\'t so many cars on the road, that would never be an issue. Saving money is always an advantage especially in today\\'s economy, and all you have to do is limit your car usage. \"As of April 2013, the number of miles drive per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995(Source 4).\" The reasoning behind that is because people \"could not afford new cars, and and the unemployed weren\\'t going to work anyway(Source 4).\" Riding with a friend is always a way to save money and limit traffic too.\\n\\nCar usage is a big problem in today\\'s society. Eliminating stress, lowering air pollution, reducing traffic, and saving money are all advantages of limiting car usage that will lead our planet to a healthier and better living. When your parents surprise you with that pimped out bike instead of a car on your birthday, just remember all the beneficial reasons of limiting car usage and plus, you won\\'t have to pay car insurance.

       " \"I think that it is a good idea for schools to let parents moniter their kids grades and attenence online. This way parents can see how their kids are doing in school and if they need to help them out at home. It also lets parents see if their kids are skipping school or not doing their work.\\n\\nFor example, if a student is failing a class, their parent can see that and help them study or get a tutor. This can help the student pass the class and do better in school. Also, if a student is missing a lot of school, their parent can see that and figure out why. Maybe the student is being bullied and doesn't want to go to school. The parent can then talk to the school and help the student feel safe.\\n\\nAnother reason this is a good idea is that it helps parents stay involved in their kids education. Some parents work a lot and can't come to school to see how their kids are doing. This way they can check online and see how their kids are doing anytime.\\n\\nHowever, some people might think that this is an invasion of privacy for the student. They might think that the student should be able to keep their grades and attenence private. But, I think that parents should be able to see this information so they can help their kids succeed.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I think that schools should let parents moniter their kids grades and attenence online. This helps parents stay involved in their kids education, helps students who are struggling, and keeps students accountable for their work.\\n\\nPlease provide feedback as if you were a teacher grading this essay.\",\n",

       " \"Most students try their best to avoid learning over the summer. As a result, they forget the knowledge they learned in the prior school year and aren't prepared for the upcoming school year. To get used to learning again, student's brains need to be refreshed and stimulated in the beginning of every school year.\\n\\nAs an attempt to solve this problem, teachers assign summer projects. Students, often times, despise these projects because they are boring and stressful. However, these projects are neccessary because they ensure students don't forget about school. To make the projects more enjoyable for students, they should design the projects instead of teachers. Student-designed projects would be better because they focus on their interests, have higher quality, and be less stressful.\\n\\nIn most cases, students don't find school work interesting because the topics aren't based around things students care about. Students get tired of learning about the same meaningless things that have no value in their lives. The things they are taught in school can't be applied to the real world and are based around a broken system that focuses on grades and memorization, not learing. Student-designed projects would focus on their interests. Students would actually want to learn compared to falling asleep in their history class listening to something that happened 900 years ago. Students could assign themselves a project based on a book they enjoy or a phenonom they find mysterious. Students would work and have fun doing it. The projects would still be educational and purposeful, but students wouldn't feel forced to do it.\\n\\nIt is a known fact that if people love what they do, they will put more effort into it. When people don't enjoy their work, they don't care as much and don't try as hard. This concept can be applied to student-designed projects. For once, students would be excited to work and learn because they get the chance to do something their passionate about. Students would put more effort into their projects. As a result, their quality of work and overall project would be much better compared to if they had to work on a teacher-designed project. They would get higher grades and teachers would be impressed with their work.\\n\\nSchool is extremely stressful for students throughout the school year. The workload is intense and hard to manage. Teachers give difficult test and assign massive piles of homework that students have to complete for typically seven classes. Students feel pressure to attain good grades. This can lead to terrible sleep patterns, mental breakdowns, and anxiety attacks. Outside factors can also add to their stress. Students have to deal with their social and family problems, which can be emotionally traumatizing. Students also partake in clubs and sports or have jobs that just add to their workload. Summer is a much needed break for students because they can escape from the stress that the school year brings. On their break, the last thing students want is another stressful project. Student-designed projects would reduce their stress significantly. They wouldn't feel as much pressure to meet their teachers standards and would wouldn't procrastinate as much. Student-designed projects would encourage learning for students without incorporating the factor of stress that comes along with school work.\\n\\nSome might say that student-designed projects wouldn't focus on real topics or be taken seriously by the students. However, teachers could approve the designs to make sure they are educational. Teachers can also grade the projects like teacher-designed projects to make sure students don't blow the project off. Students will enjoy these projects much more because they can have fun with it. These projects will also help them learn over the summer break and prepare them for the school year. Student-designed projects are much better than teacher-designed projects because they focus on the students interests, increase their quality of work, and take away stress. Student-designed summer break projects should be implemented into more school systems around America.\\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   \\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\",\n",
       " \" Most students appreciate the summer break, but some educators argue that the extended vacation is too long and students have difficulty retaining information when they return to school in the fall. Some people propose a year-round school system with shorter breaks in the summer, winter, and spring.\\n\\nThe idea that students do not need long vacations because they cannot retain information is a common argument among some educators. However, students in high school are going through significant changes in their lives and need time off to explore and find their first job. Additionally, some students need to travel to other countries to visit their families and require a longer vacation. If students do not have a good long vacation, they can become stressed and suffer from other mental health problems.\\n\\nImplementing a year-round school system with shorter breaks would not be practical as it would not cater to all students' needs. Some students require time to find independence, while others prefer to spend time with their families or study at home. In essence, students need time to explore the world and gain new experiences outside of the classroom, which is only possible during vacation periods.\\n\\nEducators and others who advocate for short vacations argue that students need to retain information from previous classes. However, students only need to study during the school year, and a long summer vacation can be detrimental to their learning. Students cannot retain information for an extended period, and they require more time in school to learn and repeat the information from previous years.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the debate over the length of summer vacations is ongoing, with some educators and students advocating for shorter breaks, while others argue for longer periods. While there are valid arguments on both sides, it is essential to consider the unique needs of each student and provide them with the necessary time off to explore the world and retain information.\",\n",
       " \"As an 8th-grade student, I believe that both traditional in-person educational instruction and distance learning instruction have their advantages and disadvantages. While traditional in-person instruction provides students with the opportunity to interact with their peers and teachers face-to-face, distance learning allows for more flexibility and convenience.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of traditional in-person instruction is the opportunity for students to interact with their peers and teachers. This interaction allows for the development of social skills and the ability to collaborate with others. Additionally, in-person instruction provides students with immediate feedback from their teachers, which can help them identify areas where they need to improve.\\n\\nOn the other hand, distance learning provides students with more flexibility and convenience. Students can learn at their own pace, and they can access course materials at any time. This allows students to balance their studies with other commitments, such as work or family responsibilities. Additionally, distance learning can be more cost-effective than traditional in-person instruction, as it eliminates the need for commuting and other expenses associated with attending classes on-campus.\\n\\nHowever, there are also some disadvantages to both forms of instruction. One disadvantage of traditional in-person instruction is that it can be difficult for students to attend classes if they live far away from the school. Additionally, in-person instruction can be less accessible for students with disabilities, as they may need specialized accommodations that are not available in a traditional classroom setting.\\n\\nDistance learning also has its disadvantages. One disadvantage is that students may feel isolated and disconnected from their peers and teachers. Additionally, distance learning can be more challenging for students who require more structure and guidance in their studies. Without the support of their peers and teachers, these students may struggle to stay on track and achieve their academic goals.\\n\\nIn my personal opinion, both traditional in-person instruction and distance learning instruction have their advantages and disadvantages. Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on the individual student's needs and circumstances. For students who require more structure and guidance in their studies, traditional in-person instruction may be the best option. However, for students who need more flexibility and convenience, distance learning may be the better choice.\\n\\nIn conclusion, both traditional in-person instruction and distance learning instruction have their advantages and disadvantages.

       " 'Taking action rather than being a passive dreamer has three key advantages: \\n\\nFirst, taking action will make your dreams more achievable. Instead of languishing in the hypothetical, you can take concrete steps toward making your goals a reality. For example, if you want to get a new job, you can take action by researching companies in your industry, updating your resume, and attending networking events.\\n\\nSecond, taking action helps you gain momentum. When you take one step, it’s easier to take the next. With each new action you take, you’ll find yourself closer to your goal. For example, if you’re starting a business, you might take action by researching potential markets, writing a business plan, and creating a website.\\n\\nLastly, taking action can help you make meaningful connections. Taking actions in pursuit of a goal can open you up to new relationships and collaborations. For example, if you’re trying to launch a project, you can take action by joining relevant Facebook groups, attending local meetups, and actively engaging with potential collaborators.\\n\\nBy taking action as opposed to just dreaming, you can make your goals more achievable, gain momentum, and build meaningful connections - three clear reasons to take action rather than remain inactive.',\n",
       " \"Asking for advice is a crucial aspect of personal growth and development. It is essential to recognize that we all make mistakes and that seeking guidance from others can help us learn from these mistakes and make more informed decisions in the future. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of asking for advice and the potential risks of not asking for advice in various situations.\\n\\nOne of the primary benefits of asking for advice is that it allows us to learn from our mistakes. When we seek advice from others, we gain a different perspective on our situation. This new perspective can help us see things that we may have missed, and it can help us identify areas where we can improve. For example, if you are struggling with a particular project at school, asking for advice from a teacher or a classmate can help you identify areas where you need to focus your efforts and improve your skills.\\n\\nAnother benefit of asking for advice is that it can help us make more informed decisions. When we seek advice from others, we gain access to their knowledge and experience. This knowledge and experience can help us make decisions that are better suited to our situation. For example, if you are trying to decide on a college major, asking for advice from someone who has experience in that field can help you make a more informed decision about which major is right for you.\\n\\nHowever, there are also potential risks to not asking for advice. One of the main risks is that we may make mistakes that we could have avoided if we had sought guidance from others. For example, if you are trying to start a business, not asking for advice from someone who has experience in that field could lead you to make mistakes that could ultimately fail your business.\\n\\nAnother risk of not asking for advice is that we may not be able to learn from our mistakes. If we don't seek guidance from others, we may not be able to identify areas where we need to improve. This lack of self-awareness can make it difficult for us to grow and develop as individuals.\\n\\nIt is important to note that not all advice is created equal. It is essential to seek advice from people who have experience and knowledge in the area you need guidance on. For example, if you are looking for advice on starting a business, it would be more beneficial to seek advice from someone who has successfully started a business than from someone who has only read about it.\\n\\nIn conclusion, asking for advice is an\",\n",

       " 'Social media has become an integral part of our daily lives, and its impact on society has been a topic of much debate. While some argue that social media has a significant impact on societal norms and values, others believe that its impact is minimal. In my opinion, social media does have a significant impact on societal norms and values, and I will provide reasons and examples to support my position.\\n\\nFirstly, social media has the power to shape our beliefs and attitudes. The content we consume on social media platforms, such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, can influence our opinions and beliefs on various issues. For instance, the #MeToo movement, which started on social media, brought attention to the widespread problem of sexual harassment and assault, and sparked a global conversation about consent and power. Similarly, social media has been instrumental in raising awareness about climate change, racial injustice, and mental health. Social media platforms have given people a voice and a platform to share their experiences, which can shape societal norms and values.\\n\\nSecondly, social media has changed the way we communicate and interact with each other. Social media platforms have made it easier for people to connect with each other, regardless of their geographical location. This has led to the creation of online communities that transcend traditional boundaries, allowing people to connect with others who share similar interests and values. Social media has also enabled people to express themselves and share their thoughts and opinions with others, fostering a sense of community and belonging.\\n\\nHowever, social media also has its downsides. Social media platforms can be breeding grounds for hate speech, cyberbullying, and online harassment. These negative aspects of social media can have a damaging impact on individuals and society as a whole. For example, cyberbullying can lead to low self-esteem, depression, and even suicide. Hate speech can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and discrimination, creating a toxic and divisive environment.\\n\\nIn conclusion, social media has a significant impact on societal norms and values. While it has the power to shape our beliefs and attitudes, and enable us to connect with others, it also has its downsides. It is important for individuals and society as a whole to be mindful of the potential negative impacts of social media, and to use these platforms responsibly. By promoting positive and respectful online interactions, we can create a safe and inclusive online community that fosters empathy, understanding, and respect for all individuals.',\n",
       " 'Are you the kind of person that is really interested in political stuff? Politics can be a subject that will start fights, but not everyone is so interested. You must know what the electoral college is. It is a system where when you vote for your president you are actually voting for a group of electors that will then vote for the presidentSource 1. This means that even if there is a majority in the popularity vote from the people. The electoral college can over rule that and vote for the other. Some say the electoral college is good because it prevents ties or because it will make sure there is a winner. But if they can over rule your vote are you really voting for your president? I say the electoral college is a bad system and it needs to be extinguished.\\n\\nThere is no doubt that you should get to decide who your leader will be. And if the electoral college can over rule your vote do you really feel like it\\'s your decision? In the 2000 presidential race, Al Gore lost because he recieved the most popularity votes from the people but the electoral college voted for Bush insteadSource 2. This means that the people thought Al Gore should be the president but instead they didn\\'t get what they wanted because the electoral college thought otherwise. Do you think this is in anyway fair? The majority of the country ended up unhappy with the election because of ther electoral college. I say that alone is enough reason to abolish the electoral college. If it happens once it can happen again. Do you want to feel cheated and betrayed again? Let\\'s get rid of the electoral college!\\n\\nSome others may say that they support the electoral college because it can\\'t have a tie. \"Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winnertakeall basis, even a very slight plurality ina state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state.\"Source 3. It is still possible to have a tie though because there are 538 total votes and since that is an even number then it can happen. And if there is just a slight difference and instead the electoral college creates a landslide then that isn\\'t representing the actuall number of the votes by the people. Once again you are being cheated out of your sya it the election. The hardest thing to understand is why people would still support something that doesn\\'t support them. The electoral college basically throws away your votes and replaces them with theirs. And once again, it is possible for ties in the electoral college due to the even number of votes.\\n\\n\"Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much to say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters.\"Source 2. This alone shows that your votes are being represented equally. It is saying that 500,000 votes are equal to 35 million votes. Isn\\'t it obvious that those two numbers are very different and they could have a very large effect on the popularity of each candidate that they are voting for? but instead they have they same effect and the 34.5 million voters that don\\'t get their fair say could very possibly be unhappy with the turnout of the president. The people are supposed to be the ones that vote for their leader, not a group of 538 \"qualified\" politicians that can over rule the entire country\\'s vote. It\\'s ridiculous how the system works and you are crazy if you support it. I know i want my fair share of input and the electoral college won\\'t allow that.\\n\\nThere are supporters who say that they support the electoral college because it avoids runoff elections. Because even if there is a tie in the majority votes from the people it is unlikey for there to be a tie in the votes from the electoral college. \"For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral College...\"Source 3. In my opinion if there is a tie in the popularity votes then they should revote, it may take longer but it will still be a decision by the people. Just because it makes the procces faster doesnt mean it makes the procces better. They can create a better system in the event of a tie instead of electors over ruling the people and picking whoever they think is best. That isnt government for the people, by the people.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the electoral college needs to be extinguished for many reasons. those reasons are because it doesn\\'t let the people vote for who they want and it over rules a notions votes. And because it doesnt show the number of votes as equall. Some may say that it is good because it prevents a tie but if there is a tie then I\\'m sure htere are better ways to revote. we need government for the people, by the people and that isn\\'t what the electoral college is.',\n",
       " 'Hot topics in today\\'s world are pollution and global warming. While there is still debate, many people agree that cutting down society\\'s use of cars would help the world be a better place. Greater limitation of car use will reduce pollution and better society.\\n\\nTo commence, reduction of car use will reduce pollution. Pollution is essentially hurting the planet as a whole, as well as all the organisms living in it. In fact, Paris, France, has recently taken action against car use effectively. According to Robert Duffer, \"[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.\" In only a few days, after banning half of the diesel and gas-run cars in the cities per day, \"The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.\" If such a change can happen in under a week, the entire world could benefit greatly from adopting similar policies. In the U.S, things are also turning around for the better. According to\\n\\nThe New York Times\\n\\n\\'s article, \"The End of Car Culture,\" \"transportaion is the second largest source of America\\'s emissions, just behind power plants.\" This is largely due to car culture in the U.S, which is fortunately declining. In fact, in the same article, it is said \"As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995.\" This shows that America is well on it\\'s way to becoming a greener nation without having to make dramatic changes to it\\'s way of life.\\n\\nContinuing, more limited car use can better society, or at least work in a community. Society is currently too dependant on cars. However, Vauban, Germany is starting to change that. In another\\n\\nNew York Times article, Elisabeth Rosenthal states, \"70 percent of Vauban\\'s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here.\" The remaining thirty percent of people hardly use their own cars for anything more than distant traveling, as most of Vauban\\'s streets are \"car-free.\" This can show that a population of people, (in this case over 5,000 of them) can survive without constantly being behind a wheel. In another case, in Bogota, Columbia, there is a designated holiday to celebrate not using cars. Appropriately titled, \"Day Without Cars\" is an annual event held in order \"to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog,\" according to the\\n\\nSeattle Times\\'s\\n\\nAndrew Selsky. While it may sound silly, the event had a huge turnout in spite of bad weather. Other cities joined into the fun after a few years, and also in the article, Enrique Riera, the mayor of a Paraguay town, said of the event, \"\\'These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders.\\'\" The simple effort to better the world has brought people together for a good cause.\\n\\nIn retrospect, the idea of declining the use of cars will help humanity as a whole greatly. Doing so would simultaneously slow down the destruction of the Earth for all organisms inside of it, and also help the human race better itself socially.    ',\n",
       " 'I despise it when someone your close to says \"you can\\'t be like me you have to be better than that.\" What right do you have to speak on what I have done, when you have done things people could not even imagine? This is why when it comes to someone you look up too or base your personality off of, make sure it is one who has credibility. Like people always say \"you are who you hang around with.\" For example, being around friends who act in illegal activities your bound to do those things too. A man with honor, integrity, and takes responsibility for what he does will be respected because of his behavior.\\n\\nBeing a good role model is especially true when it comes to children. For example, have you ever had a little cousin or your bestfriend\\'s baby sibling copy the same exact words that come out of your mouth? Be careful what you talk about around a kid because they repeat what you say; furthermore, it might not seem like it, but they can process everything you say. This is how in parts of the country people have various accents and pronounce words differently. When you grow up in a certain neighborhood or even in you household, while aging you will be using the different terms and phrases people around you use because that\\'s all you ever known growing up. So staying away from words that can\\'t be used in a school or around familly is your best bet.\\n\\nA celebrity has an even greater audience when it comes to setting an example for others. People of all types of ages watch them, they are the ones who set the trends, the news revolves around, and control social media. When a celebrity messes up they get the most hate; however, if a celebrity does a great deed like a charity event then they\\'re praised for it. They attract the most attention and most of those eyes are teenagers, who need the most advice and a figure to follow. For teenagers this is who decides for them if they\\'ll be on the streets or in the books because famous people are who they spend most of their time with. Teenagers are always watching, whether on social media, a reality show, a sports game, or a movie, celebrities are dominating the world right now.\\n\\nNo mater who it is, a person always have some type of influence on somebody. That is why you should just hold that anger in next time you get in a fight because people are watching. Do some charity or show them you cleaning up the environment; in addition, just effect others in a positive way. However some would say setting example does not matter or no one pays attention to that, it is suprising how many people are effected by a person\\'s behavior. Showing a good example with behavior does not necessarily mean change who you are, it just means be careful of the words that are exiting your mouth. No one would want their own kid to be effected by a bad role model.',\n",

In a society that is constantly trying to make people be someone else, it is crucial to hold on to our true selves and not let others define us. In this essay, I will discuss the importance of being true to oneself and provide examples from my personal experience.\\n\\nIn today's society, people are constantly pressured to fit into certain roles and expectations. Whether it is the pressure to be successful, attractive, or popular, people are constantly trying to mold themselves into someone they are not. This can lead to feelings of insecurity, low self-esteem, and even depression. However, when we are true to ourselves, we feel confident and comfortable in our own skin.\\n\\nPersonally, I have experienced the importance of being true to oneself. When I was younger, I was constantly trying to fit in with my peers and be someone I was not. I would wear clothes that I didn't like, listen to music that I didn't enjoy, and try to be popular with people I didn't really care about. However, as I got older, I realized that I was not happy and that I needed to be true to myself.\\n\\nWhen I started being true to myself, I felt a sense of liberation and freedom. I started wearing clothes that I actually liked, listening to music that I enjoyed, and spending time with people who truly cared about me. I stopped trying to be someone I was not and started living my life on my own terms. This led to an increase in my self-esteem and overall happiness.\\n\\nAnother example of the importance of being true to oneself is in the workplace. In many jobs, there is pressure to conform to certain standards and expectations. However, when we are true to ourselves, we can bring our unique skills and talents to the workplace. This can lead to greater success and job satisfaction.\\n\\nIn conclusion, being true to oneself is essential in a society that is constantly trying to make people be someone else. When we are true to ourselves, we feel confident and comfortable in our own skin, leading to an increase in self-esteem and overall happiness. By being true to ourselves, we can also bring our unique skills and talents to the workplace, leading to greater success and job satisfaction.\",\n",
       " \"When it comes to making a choice it can be hard, don't worry others can help. Don't be too overwelmed because your peers will lead the way. Getting other people's advice is key to getting the best outcome. I know personally I look up to my peers for advice. Here's how it can help you make the best choice.\\n\\nFirst, your peers know you. Most of your close friends and family have known you for awhile. Your family sees the way you work and truly knows all about you. It's important to get advice from them because they will help you make the best choice. Others also see you from a different point of view so it's not all about the way you see yourself. They watch you go about life and they'll know if it's the right choice for you. You also have a bond and trust with the people you talk to. They would never lie or let you down. If they knew it wasn't right for you they would stop you before making that choice. It's important to trust those that you go to, they should be honest and trustworthy. Family and friends know your lifestyle and would let you know if that choice wouldn't be right for your life. Getting advice from others that know you well is one way to make the best choice.\\n\\nSecondly, your peers that you go to have experience. Everyone has had to make a choice. Whether it was small or something very important they can still help. Anyone from siblings to teachers are always open to talk with you. I have an older sister and she helps me out a lot because she's experienced similar situations. For example school, she's been through more grades than me, she really is someone with experience to help me out. Going to others that are older works well for me. Like my parents, they've raised me and have been through more than I have. They've experienced a lot and have been in my shoes. I can always count on them for advice. Friends are also great for advice, you have a bond and can truly relate to their life. Family and friends care for you, they wouldn't let you make the wrong choice. It's also smart to go to others because there experience might've not been well. So it's better to go to them so you don't get yourself into a bad position. Going to family and friends with experience is another way to make the best choice.\\n\\nLastly, your peers will help you and guide you to the best choice. Never make a choice right away, it can lead to a bad experience. You never known what your getting into. Especially go to your parents, they need to agree with your decision. Even if you think it's right others may not. It can be hard sometimes because everyone has there own opinion. At first your peers may disagree but that's why it's so important to talk things out. In the end it's about compromise and that can result in the best thing for you. When asking for advice others might have other ideas. Always let them share with you because it could be better for you. Like I mentioned earlier others have experience. So it's very important because they will help you. Family and friends will always guide you to what's right, so trust them. Talking things through always makes me feel better because decisions can be stressful. Letting others talk you through it will guide you to the best choice.\\n\\nIn conclusion, it's very important to go to others for advice. They know you, they are experienced, and will guide you through it. Going to others will truly give you the best outcome and will be less stressful for you. Next time you have to make a decision definitely talk to your peers because they will help you make the best choice.\",\n",
       " \" The impact of technology on human relationships has been a topic of debate for many years. While some argue that technology has limited human contact, others believe that it has brought people closer together. In this essay, we will explore both sides of the argument and determine whether technology has had a positive or negative effect on people's lives.\\n\\nOn the one hand, technology has allowed people to maintain relationships with friends and family who are far away. With the advent of video calls and social media, people can now easily stay in touch with loved ones regardless of their location. This has made it easier for people to maintain long-distance relationships and stay connected with people from different parts of the world.\\n\\nIn addition, technology has made it easier for people to meet new people and be more social. With the rise of online dating and social media platforms, people can now connect with like-minded individuals from all over the world. This has made it easier for people to find new friends and expand their social circles.\\n\\nOn the other hand, some argue that technology has limited human contact. With the rise of social media and texting, people are spending more time interacting with screens than with real people. This has led to a decline in face-to-face communication and a rise in feelings of isolation and loneliness.\\n\\nFurthermore, technology has also led to a decline in the quality of human relationships. With the ease of communication, people are now more likely to have superficial relationships that lack depth and intimacy. This has led to a decline in the overall quality of human relationships and a rise in feelings of disconnection and loneliness.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the impact of technology on human relationships is complex and multifaceted. While technology has allowed people to maintain relationships and meet new people, it has also led to a decline in face-to-face communication and a rise in superficial relationships. Ultimately, the impact of technology on human relationships will depend on how people choose to use it and how they balance the convenience of technology with the importance of face-to-face communication.\",\n",

I think it\\'s pretty cool how we can just use our phones to talk to people now instead of actually having to see them in person. Like, I can be hanging out with my friends and I\\'m like, \"Hey, what\\'s up?\" and they\\'re like, \"Not much, just chillin\\' on my phone.\" And then we just keep talking like that for hours. It\\'s like, super convenient.\\n\\nBut, there are some downsides to this too. Like, sometimes I\\'ll be hanging out with my friends and we\\'ll all be on our phones the whole time. And we\\'re not even talking to each other, we\\'re just scrolling through our feeds. It\\'s like, we\\'re not even present in the moment. And sometimes I\\'ll be in class and everyone\\'s on their phones and we\\'re not even paying attention to the teacher. It\\'s like, we\\'re not even learning anything.\\n\\nAnd then there\\'s the whole privacy thing. Like, I don\\'t want people to see everything I\\'m doing on my phone. I don\\'t want them to know what I\\'m looking at or who I\\'m talking to. It\\'s like, my business is my business and I don\\'t want anyone else to know about it.\\n\\nBut, on the other hand, technology can also help us connect with people who are far away. Like, my cousin lives in another state and we can Facetime and talk to each other. It\\'s like, we\\'re not even apart. And my grandma lives in another country and we can Skype and see each other. It\\'s like, we\\'re not even separated by distance.\\n\\nSo, I think technology can be both good and bad when it comes to human contact. It\\'s like, it can bring people together but also push them apart. It\\'s all about how we use it and how we balance it with real-life human interaction.\\n\\nIn conclusion, technology can have both positive and negative effects on human contact. It\\'s important to find a balance between using technology to connect with others and also making',\n",

Knowledge is cool and all, but it\\'s not as cool as being able to imagine something and make it a reality. Like, have you ever seen a building that was designed by someone who just drew it in their head? It\\'s like, whoa! 🤯\\n\\nAnd don\\'t even get me started on math. Like, sure, it\\'s important to know how to calculate stuff and all, but where would we be without imagination?

       " \"I think we should definitely transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. First of all, fossil fuels are finite resource, which means they will eventually run out. This means that we will have to find alternative sources of energy anyway, so why not start now? Additionally, fossil fuels are really bad for the environment. They release greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change and pollution, which can cause health problems for humans and animals.\\n\\nOn the other hand, renewable energy sources like solar and wind power are sustainable and don't produce harmful emissions. They are also becoming more affordable and efficient as technology advances. For example, the cost of solar panels has decreased significantly over the past decade, making it more accessible to people and businesses.\\n\\nAnother benefit of renewable energy is that it can create jobs. Installing and maintaining solar panels and wind turbines requires skilled workers, which can boost local economies. In fact, renewable energy already employs more people than the fossil fuel industry in the United States.\\n\\nFinally, transitioning to renewable energy can increase energy independence. Countries that rely heavily on fossil fuels are often subject to price fluctuations and geopolitical tensions. By using renewable energy, we can reduce our reliance on foreign oil and improve our energy security.\\n\\nIn conclusion, transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy is a no-brainer. It's better for the environment, it's sustainable, it can create jobs, and it can increase energy independence. We should definitely make the switch as soon as possible.\",\n",

       " 'Do you think doing school work from home would be beneficial for you? Working at home instead of going to school sounds like it would be a great experience. Students could wake up at any time they want and could work at a pace that is good for them. However, there are a ton of disadvantages. Working from home through video conferences and online would be very distracting for students and the teacher would not be there in person to help with specific questions.\\n\\nThere are few students that would benefit from doing school work at home. Kids that would benefit would be students that do not have siblings to distract them, students that do not have pets in their house, and students that do well when learning in loud environments. There are very few students that would fall under these categories. I have noticed that many of my classmates including myself have a very hard time concentrating when they are in a noisy environment, and they end up doing poorly on the assignment when it is loud. Working at school where it is quiet is the best place for students to succeed.\\n\\nThere are many distractions at home, such as: your family being noise, television on in the background, and having pets in your house. Having television and video games around would be very tempting to go on instead of continuing to do school work. Pets and family being loud is a huge distraction and will cause students to get\\xa0distracted from their work they are trying to do. When I come home from school to do my homework my family is so loud and distracting, therefore; I get distracted and end up watching television and play video games\\xa0instead of doing my homework. Having a loud environment to work in is extremely distracting and could lead to not doing well in school.\\n\\nWorking from home could be very frustrating when students do not have their teacher right there to help them. It is the teachers job to be there for their students and answer any questions they need help with. Not being in the classroom with a teacher would make learning much more difficult and could lead to less success for students. I go to my math teacher very often to get help. When she helps me we always look at problems on a piece of paper together to help me understand the material better. I definitely would not do as well in math class if I could not have my teacher with me to show me how to understand the problems. Working with teachers face to face is a key factor to do well in school, so every student should be able to have this opportunity.\\n\\nUltimately, going to school to do work is the best way for students to learn. It would not be distracting and students would have their teachers with them in person to help them. Everyone should have the opportunity to do well in school. A key factor for students to do well is to have a quiet and non distracting learning environment. The best environment for student to be as successful as possible is to learn in a classroom at school.\\xa0',\n",

I mean, think about it – we can communicate with people all over the world in seconds, learn new things from the comfort of our own homes, and even order food without leaving our beds! 🍔👀\\n\\nOne of the ways Technology has had a positive effect is on the economy. With the rise of e-commerce, people can buy and sell stuff online, which has created a whole new industry. Plus, apps like Venmo and PayPal make it easy to send money to friends and family without having to carry cash around. 💰\\n\\nAnother way Technology has helped is in education. There are so many online resources and tools that make learning way more fun and interactive. For example, you can use Khan Academy to learn math and science, or Duolingo to learn a new language. Plus, you can even take online classes and earn college credit! 🎓\\n\\nBut I think the way Technology has had the most positive effect is on families. With video calls, we can see our relatives who live far away and talk to them like they're right in the room. And with social media, we can stay in touch with our friends and family even when we're not physically near them. It's like having a big ol' virtual hug! 🤗\\n\\nOf course, there are some downsides to Technology, like how it can be distracting and how it can make people feel lonely or isolated. But overall, I think the benefits of Technology far outweigh the drawbacks. It's like the old saying goes – with great power comes great responsibility! 💪\\n\\nSo there you have it – Technology has had a super positive impact on our lives, and I'm glad we have it! 😊\",\n",
       " 'I believe that people should adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet because it is better for the environment and can improve our health. There are many reasons why reducing meat consumption is important.\\n\\nFirstly, producing meat requires a lot of resources such as water, land, and energy. According to research, it takes about 1,800 gallons of water to produce just one pound of beef. This means that the meat industry is a major contributor to water scarcity, especially in areas where water is already scarce. Additionally, the land used for grazing and growing feed for livestock could be used for other purposes, such as growing crops for human consumption or preserving natural habitats.\\n\\nSecondly, eating too much meat has been linked to various health problems, such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. A diet high in red and processed meats has been shown to increase the risk of these diseases, while a plant-based diet can help reduce the risk. Vegetarian and vegan diets are also typically lower in saturated fat and cholesterol, which can further improve heart health.\\n\\nLastly, adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet can also help reduce animal cruelty. Many animals are raised in cramped and unsanitary conditions, and are often subjected to cruel practices such as debeaking, castration, and tail docking. By reducing our consumption of animal products, we can help reduce the demand for these practices.\\n\\nWhile some may argue that meat is an important source of protein and other nutrients, there are plenty of plant-based sources of these nutrients. For example, legumes, nuts, and seeds are all good sources of protein. Additionally, a well-planned vegetarian or vegan diet can provide all the necessary nutrients for a healthy lifestyle.\\n\\nIn conclusion, reducing meat consumption is important for the environment, our health, and animal welfare. By adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet, we can help reduce our impact on the planet and improve our own health.',\n",
       " 'When it comes to classrooms, having teachers design projects for students can be just as beneficial as having students come up with their own ideas. In my experience, having a teacher-designed project gave me a starting point to expanding my knowledge and learning. Instead of having to think of an idea from scratch, I had a framework to work off of – the challenge was figuring out ways to take that project and make it my own. Instead of feeling overwhelmed with the project, I could focus on understanding the concepts I was presented with, and use that knowledge to come up with my own creative solutions or ideas. \\n\\nResearch has also suggested that when teachers structure and guide learning, it leads to better academic outcomes for students. A study published in the International Journal of Research and Reviews in Applied Sciences showed that when students were given guidance, structure and support, their overall learning experience improved. Specifically, when teachers designed projects, students reported feeling more confident and comfortable in their learning environment. \\n\\nIn conclusion, having teachers design projects provides many benefits for students that they wouldn’t experience if they were designing them on their own. It is an effective way to guide student learning and understanding, while still allowing students to express their creativity and come up with their own solutions.',\n",
       " \"When someone needs help making a choice, they might ask different people for their opinions. This is because getting multiple opinions can help them make a better choice. For example, if someone is trying to decide which movie to watch, they might ask their friends what they thought of the movies they saw. If most of their friends say that one movie was really good, that person might choose to watch that movie.\\n\\nAnother reason why seeking multiple opinions can help is because different people have different experiences and knowledge. For instance, if someone is trying to decide which college to go to, they might ask their parents, teachers, and guidance counselor for their opinions. Their parents might have more experience with paying for college, their teachers might know more about the academic programs at different colleges, and their guidance counselor might have more information about the application process. By getting advice from all of these people, the person can make a more informed decision.\\n\\nIn conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it gives them different perspectives and more information to consider. It's always a good idea to talk to different people and get their opinions before making a big decision.\",\n",

The reason why is because the computer can read emotiaonal expressions of students so the consulors can use the techology to thier advange. As the text says Mona Lisa was 83 percent happy 9 percent disgusted and also 6 percent fearful. Imagine having a consulor having that type of tech in their hands. Their would be less fights less sucdial tenions and aslo less bullying.\\n\\nThe technology could also make alot of students smile. As the text states you can conduct an experiment by going to the bathroom and raise your lips at the conroners of your mouth, then squint your eyes slighty to produce wrinkling at the croners of your eyes. And also by holding that raise the outers parts of your cheek up towrad your eyes. They say doing all those faces and experiments can make a person happy just by trying it. Also putting a happy face on your face could infunces others to try the same thing and get the same resluts.\\n\\nAlso if a techaer wanted to prove that the emotional expression technology is vaulable they could set up a way to let the students use and play with the tech. That would let student exprence and see how the technology works and function so that in the future they would know how to use it to. This information can also take technology and others courses to a different level. The reason why is becuase if students learn how to take contorl of this technology they can try to forge it into their own work of art and make it better than before. as the text says your home PC cant handle the complex alogrithms used to decode mona lisa's smile but we can write down simple instructions that encode different emotions. That states there to me that if students get thier hands this type of tech they could alter the world solve problems in a insict or a heart beat and even help bring bullying to a end. Students may think letting the system read their emations is a bad thing or might them feel uncomfortbale but it shouldn't. It's to help them and the teacher have a better relationship and aslo solve problems faster.\",\n",

In the passage it states, \"On the planet\\'s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" This clearly gives enough information to say that these conditions are more extreme than what any human can handle.\\n\\nA way we could be able to visit Venus is if we had better technology.

In the paragraph 8 the author claims, \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imaginations and innovations.\" From this authors statement we can infer that they are on board with the idea of the travels to Venus and that we should not like dangers or doubts hold us back from being able to study this planet.

In the next few paragraphs I will explain the reasons I can think of why you need multiple peoples advice. Although I feel I need to clarify why we need advice in general. Advice is mainly helpful for learning, also it can help those who don't see what they should do, but if you got bad advice it might effect your whole life. Now that I've clarified that, time to continue with the question.\\n\\nFirst reason, multiple viewpoints on the topic or compare and contrast. Now this reason would probably apply to someone who is seeking advice before a decision. An example of this reason : Generic_Name needs a new bike,so he goes in the bike shop and ask his friends for advice on which bike he should get and they do now. Generic_Name goes to the counter and the cashier gives him some advice so now he can compare and contrast the bikes in his head and decide which one to get. In the example Generic_Name has three point of views on the different bikes so he could easily make a choice. This is like research but from people who have done the research. Also Advice comes from friends and family mostly so you Know it isn't bad advice.\\n\\nSecond reason, bad advice. when you get bad advice you what to get more advice from some one else or maybe you don't even know if it is bad advice that is why always get more than one person to get advice from. Now for an example: You just turned twenty and you're still living with your parents so you go to your bad friend house because you think he has cool job probably. So you get to his house then ask him and he says you could join my gang we do cool things and get a lot\\xa0a money you think about talking to your other friend but then you say yes anyway. The next day you go to jail for murder because your friend comited murder to rob a bank. You were sitting in a car waiting\\xa0for your friend to get out of the bank you didn't think that he hurt or robed anyone. Now you in prison for forty years and your friend for life. When you were about to get your good friends advice you didn't but if you did you would realize how bad of an idea that is and would of been fine, so never be to careful.\\n\\nNow I could list a few more but these are the main ones and most important.

       " \"My friend had once been forced to be homeschooled due to an illness. She regarded it to me as the worst time of her life. She never liked school ever, but now she wanted to go back more than ever. The difference between homeschool and going to a physical school is drastic. Student's wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home, proving that technology cannot be an direct alternative to going to school.\\n\\nStudent's wouldn't benefit from being to attend classes from home because they wouldn't be able to get help from their teachers. Teachers are vital to a students success. When students struggle with a certain topic, they usually ask a teacher to help them further understand what their learning. Contacting them online rather than in person would only make it more difficult for students as sometimes they need a direct, in person explanation depending on the topic. They also make sure students are focused and are on task as their is no control of that at home. Teachers can also provide fun and creative ways to teach a lesson, rather than the same online and boring lessons. Many students that already struggle with school would only get worse.\\n\\nStudent's wouldn't benefit from being to attend classes from home because they wouldn't be able to be with their friends as much. Friends are a big incentive for kids to come to school as they can help you with problems in class if a teacher is unable to or is busy. Friends can pick you mood up when you're having a bad day. Friends are a big stress reliever as people can express their frustration to them about school, family, etc. They make school more enjoyable and a better experience. School without friends would only make it worse, as it may cause even more boredom to students being alone by themselves.\\n\\nStudent's wouldn't benefit from being to attend classes from home because they would spend more time procrastinating than learning. Many kids struggle even just getting homework done afterschool because they are on their phones, or they can't focus on a screen for too long. Lessons would take longer for students to complete, as in school there's always a teacher to help students stay focused and in check if they're not paying attention. At home, the students are completely independent, which can be difficult for some as they don't have a long attention span. Procastination only leads to unecessarily long work times for students and it can cause them to not produce the best show of work.\\n\\nIn conclusion, technology won't solve every problem as students would struggle even more if they had online school. Although a student's success is dependent on themselves, teachers, friends, and even the school environment can be helpful factors in determining how far they go educationally. Without them, many will struggle and cannot get the help they need to be successful. Education is a huge factor in where people go in life. Most of the time, a good education will get you into a good college which can spring you into a solid career afterwards. Schools should not attempt to create online schools, and should spread awareness to those that are able to come to school but are homeschool, why it's better to have their education at a physical school.\\xa0\",\n",
       " 'Hey there!  So, for this essay, I had to research how Chinese people learn and grow up, and compare it to Ralph Waldo Emerson\\'s philosophy.  I\\'m not gonna lie, it\\'s kinda hard to write about this stuff, but I\\'ll give it my best shot! \\n\\nFirst off, Chinese culture places a big emphasis on family and community.  Like, they believe that the family is the basic unit of society, and that everyone should support and take care of each other.  This means that kids are taught from a young age to respect their elders and follow traditional values.  They also have this thing called \"guanxi,\" which is like, the art of building relationships and networking.  It\\'s all about building connections and reputation, you know? \\n\\nBut, compared to Emerson, Chinese culture is way more collectivist.  Like, they prioritize the group over the individual, and they believe that individualism can lead to selfishness and disorder.  Emerson, on the other hand, thought that people should follow their own instincts and pursue their own goals, even if it means going against societal norms.  He believed in individualism and self-reliance, and he thought that people should trust themselves and their own abilities. \\n\\nNow, I know some of you might be thinking, \"But what about Confucius? Didn\\'t he teach about self-cultivation and personal growth?\"  Yeah, he did.  Confucius believed in self-cultivation and personal growth, but he also believed in following tradition and respecting authority.  So, it\\'s like, you gotta balance your own personal growth with respecting the group and following the rules. \\n\\nAnyway, in conclusion, Chinese culture and Emerson\\'s philosophy are pretty different.  Like, they both value respect and tradition, but they have different ideas about individualism and self-reliance. *',\n",
       " 'Attending online classes from home is the new way to never miss any school. I believe that online classes would be beneficial for students so they would not miss out on anything taught that day if they could not make it to school. Students will be able to benefit from taking online classes from home when they are sick, have doctor appointments, and if they miss the bus.\\n\\nGenerally students have to miss school because they are sick. When students do not come to school because they are sick they miss school work. Also when students are really sick they usually have to stay home for more than one day to get better. While in those days of getting better they are also missing a lot of school work, but online classes would be beneficial to the student so they would not miss any of the lessons that were taught in those days that they were not there.\\n\\nAnother reason why online classes would be beneficial for students is if the student has to go to a doctors appointments on a school day. Students may have doctors appointments on school days because that might be the only day their parents have time to take them. Depending on where and how many appointments they have that day the students might not be able to go to school late. So it would be a relief for the parents and the student to know that they will be able to get the information they miss through the online classes.\\n\\nFinally, students that rely on the school bus to take to them from and to school everyday would be able to benefit from online classes. Because if they miss the bus they do not have to worry about trying to get to school, or missing a day of learning. The student could just go home and get online and learn what they could have missed if they did not have the online classes. Without the online classes the student would have to try and find a way to school or have to stay after school just because they were a little late for the bus.\\n\\nAll things considered, online classes could be a positive impact for students if they have to stay home. When they call out sick they dont have to worry about missing a lesson or work. When they have doctors appointments it is very convenient\\xa0for both the student and the parents to know that they could just go online and get all the information that they missed. Also for the students that miss the bus they do not have to stress themselves out over waking up late, sleeping in, or not setting there alarm they would just be able to go on their phone and reiceive the lessons and work. Overall online classes should be implemented in every school, so that the student can have a backup plan for when they can not come to school.',\n",

Have you ever wounder why that is the case?, if you are a person who does not take advice from another individual , then you could use this skill, taking advice from another person can help you make better life choices, it will make you understand things more clearly and faster, and learn from them. Multiple opinions really is a foundation\\xa0to a job like a mayor of a city, it is vital to take advice from the community in order to address problems and concerns. If it was just a city with no voice in the community then the city would fall into a bad place which no one wants to be in and the key advice is to receive it.\\n\\nIn the world we live in, we make a lot of important choices in life, some are big and some are small, but they effect our future and success.

       " 'Have you ever wondered what school would be like if you were given the opportunity to attend classes from home? Some schools around the world offer advanced technological opportunities such as online or video conferencing. Students all around would benefit from online classes because its comfortable, convenient, and helps expand technology skills.\\n\\nIt is not an unknown fact that humans enjoy being comfortable, however this is not a privilege for those in school as individuals are expected to stay seated for eight or more hours in uncomfortable seats. Online or video conferencing gives students the opportunity to have a comfortable and safe learning environment. This is especially helpful to those who get distracted easily by others, or those who prefer to be isolated than in a large class. Students are able to focus and have an improved mood which will aid them in getting work done. Not only that, but students are not limited to their homes and they able to adjust their learning environment to the library or as they prefer. Students would benefit from online classes due to it being comfortable.\\n\\nOnline or video conferencing is convenient for students all around. Students nowadays are stressed and overworked; some having jobs that work into the night, combined with schoolwork and no room for sleep. Individuals that are able to take classes from home have the ability to work around their schedule. This helps benefit students by allowing them to balance out their lives. Those who use online classes will be more rested, focused, and willing to learn. This also teaches students time management and responsibility, as everything gets rested on their shoulders. Individuals benefit from online classes due to its convenience.\\n\\nAdvanced technological opportunities like online or video conferencing are not only comfortable and convenient, but improve technology skills. Intentional or not, students who use online or video conferencing are bound to improve their technology skills. This is a resourceful practice that will be useful for those students in the long run. Many jobs these days require some form of basic computer skills and knowledge. These students would be ahead of their competitors by having the following: being able to convert to PDF files, turning in online projects, recording projects on one device and transferring it to the computer, recording podcast for projects, improved typing and critical thinking skills. Those who attend online classes would benefit by acquiring advanced technological skills that would set them above their peers.\\n\\nThose who attend online classes have a beneficial and comfortable learning environment than those who attend school in person. Online or video conferencing is available and convenient for all students as it helps balance out the individuals life and work school around their busy schedule. Advanced technological opportunities such as providing students with online classes, ultimately benefits the students as they acquire technological skills that set them above everyone else. Providing students with the option of online classes benefits the students by setting them up for success through comfortable learning, convenience, and skill-based learning that is grasped through advanced technology.\\xa0\\xa0',\n",
       " 'When asking for advice it is better to ask multiple people rather than one person. Asking more than person can help you because not all people have the same mind set. Sometimes if you only ask one person for advice they can give you something they think is right in that situation\\xa0but it can turn out not the right advice that you needed. But if you ask multiple people like three or four and see what the common opinion is you can take the right advice. And people tend to ask more than one people because they dont want to be provided the wrong advice. And if you are provided the wrong advice you cloud lose trust.\\n\\nIt is better to ask more than one person for many reasons for example if you ask one of your friends if what you should wear to a party and they give you what they they think. And then you go and see every body there is wearing a different style than yours. But that could have been avoided if you had asked the advice of four friends and then they could have given you the style that they thought was worn. Another example is if you ask one of your friends what you should get as a snack and they give you a bag of chips and later on you dont like the chips. But if you would have asked multiple friends what a good snack was they would have probably recommended a better snack than the chips. Or if you ask if you think you should ask somebody out and they say yeah or if you ask some more friends and they dont think its that great in idea to ask that person out.\\n\\nThe advice from a group would most likely be better than by asking one of your friends. Because if you ask one person whats in style. Than can give you some advice and then you take their advice and you wear it and people dont like it. Or if you need advice on what you should do in a situation and you ask one of your close friends what they thin you should do and they give you the wrong advice you cloud wind up doing the wrong thing in that situation. And sometimes they can lead you into the wrong things would get you in trouble. Or you cloud be put in a situation that you dont know what is right and you take the wrong advice could have a bad reputation or it could lead to you losing people you were close to. And you cloud hurt somebody if you do take the wrong advice which could lead to getting shamed.\\n\\nAnd that is why asking more than one person is better than asking one person and that person only. because no matter who you ask youre probably going to get multiple answers but you can compare and see who has common advice. you want to ask the group so you dont get embarrassed in front of people or eat something that you dont like that isnt very popular among people. Or something you dont enjoy doing that person thinks is fun but it is a popular opinion to people. But if you ask a hand full of close friends or even just people you can see the common advice people will give of what they think they would do in your situation and you can see that more people think something else is right rather than the one or two people who thin something else is right.',\n",

       " \"During the summer leading up to my eighth grade year, my mom suggested that I get involved in an extracurricular activity because they are very beneficial for kids.\\n\\nI thought for a while, then took her advice and decided to play on my high school's junior varsity football team.\\n\\nWhen the practices first started that July, things were running pretty smoothly;however, once the school year started a couple of weeks later, things got a quite a lot tougher.\\n\\nI had to learn to be responsible in order to keep up with my homework every day after practice.\\n\\nAs the season went on, I learned a lot of stuff about football and school, but most importantly, I had lots of fun doing it.\\n\\nI am so glad that I took my mom's advice about extracurricular activities being beneficial to kids because I found that to be true for me as well.\\n\\nConsequently, I agree with the decision that all students should participate in an extracurricular activity because it teaches them new, real world skills, how to be responsible with their work, and how to have fun while doing something productive.\\n\\nFirst, I think all students should be in an extracurricular activity because it teaches students new, real world skills.\\n\\nThere are countless numbers of valuable techniques in the world today that are never taught within a classroom, but are needed for a successful career.\\n\\nFor example, when I played football, I learned the importance of working together\\xa0on a team with other people.\\n\\nWhen we all learned to work as one team, we started to play really good and win games.\\n\\nOn the other hand, if someone goes all throughout school and never learns the skill of teamwork, it is likely that they will not be very successful when they enter the real world because teamwork is an important skill that is needed in almost every job.\\n\\nJust imagine if you are a business owner or employer and are looking for a person that you can hire to work for you.\\n\\nWould you choose the person who was never involved in any type of after school or extracurricular activity, or would you choose the person who was very productive and was involved in many different activities throughout their schooling?\\n\\nYou would probably choose the one who was very involved in their school because that shows you that they have the skills needed to work for you and can keep up with a job.\\n\\nSecondly, everyone should be involved in an extracurricular activity because it teaches them how to be responsible with their work.\\n\\nMost kids today don't want to do their homework, and instead only do the fun stuff like play on their phones or lay on the couch like a sleeping bear, which usually results in bad grades.\\n\\nHowever, being involved in an activity teaches students that if they want to have fun and stay in their club, they must do their work before anything else.\\n\\nFor example, during football season, I had to be extremely responsible with my schoolwork and grades, or else my coach could have kicked me off of the team.\\n\\nSimilarly, being responsible can also be a key characteristic of getting into college or the workforce.\\n\\nJust like how you have a low chance of getting hired if you don't have the skills, you have an even lower chance of getting a job if you can't be responsible and maintain your job very well.\\n\\nSome of the most successful people in the world aren't necessarily the most talented or have the most skills, but they are able to keep up with all their work and maintain their position.\\n\\nLastly, extracurricular activities teach students how to have fun while doing something productive.\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, students these days only like to do the fun stuff, not the work.\\n\\nExtracurricular activities give kids the chance to have loads of fun, but also learn valuable lessons.\\n\\nAs a result of the activities being fun, students will also be more likely to stay in their club because they enjoy it, which helps both the students and the teachers get along better.\\n\\nAdditionally, most students will go away from a class and only remember the fun things that they did in it, while they will forget\\xa0about all the important stuff.\\n\\nBut in extracurricular classes, the fun parts of the class will usually directly relate to profitable skills or morals, so that when students remember the fun stuff, they will also remember the skills that they learned as well.\\n\\nFor example, one day during football practice, our coach had us do a fun drill where we got to run behind our blockers.\\n\\nI vividly remember this because it was really exciting when I got to do it, although, when I think about it, I also remember that in order to do it, I had to get low and run with the proper technique.\\n\\nIt was because of fun things like that drill that I was able to stick with the game and improve my skills.\\n\\nSo as you can see, I agree with the decision that all kids should be in an extracurricular activity because it teaches them new, real world skills, how to be responsible with their work, and how to have fun while doing something productive.\\n\\nJust like how I had to alter my work schedule when I played football, extracurricular activities might not be that easy, but I can promise you that in the long run, they are worth participating in.\\n\\nSo even if you don't think extracurricular activities are good for you, go ahead and just give one a try.\\n\\nThere are all sorts of activities out there that are available to everyone, so all you need to do is find the one that strikes your fancy.\\n\\nI guarantee that you will not regret it at all!\",\n",

       " 'The author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" has made their article over the progress of studies done on Venus, the \"Evening Star\" of our skies. They collected research and human planetary exploration of our solar system, and I\\'ll be going over claims and their ideas of just how passionately they support their ideas of studying Venus despite dangers.\\n\\nMy evaluation of the successful writings the author had written is crucially on how they told about the difficulty of the mission would be on Venus, seeing as they inform us the tempatures on the planet average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, with atmospheric pressures there being a startling 90 times greater amount than our planet, and with all this there is little knowledge about what makes up the ground, water or gas of the planet. And with all the probes we\\'ve sent last only a few hours each within each landing. On our way to finding a way to overcome these challenges we found discoveries made on the way about future planet explorations that could someday be made by humans on Venus itself.\\n\\nThe author wrote that current discoveries made by scientists show that Venus also had a past of preserving life on its planet, and even having geological landscape features similiar to Earth. The planet\\'s orbit provide nearby space travel making it a possible and easy route for planetary visits, which is crucial seeing how long space travel can take with our current modifications and technology. The article\\'s author then backs this up on NASA\\'s critical ideas and discoveries for sending humans to Venus for studies.\\n\\nA solution the researchers have proposed for tells of a floating or a blimp transportation vehicle capable of carrying people over the potential dangerous landscape and acidic clouds for closer examination of the planet around 30 miles up in the air. Despite the distance, they would still be in 170 degrees Fahrenheit weather, with pressures close to sea-levels like on Earth, but solar power generation would be easy to obtain, and radiation levels are equal to the safe places of Earth\\'s. Meaning for a difficult, but survivable enviroment for us humans to be in.\\n\\nAs invigorating as that may seem, They then tell on how undeveloped the idea still is, seeing as hovering over 30 miles would definitely avoid dangerous conditions, but also samples and direct contact with critical minerals and materials that could be discovered from below would make studies on the planet not as plentiful as it could be. Leaving options for a need to find ways for a closer, but riskier challenges to get the samples and materials they would need to make far by more accurate studies with the planet Venus.\\n\\nThey go on to tell us about machines capable of withstanding the tempatures capable of melting tin, which would be dire against tablets and cell phones we have on Earth, and how machines we\\'ve had designed in 1800\\'s could survive with some modifications, or silicon carbide simplified electronics have been made to withstand the heat and acidic conditions.\\n\\nI conclude my essay with the standpoint that the author successfully drew in readers, and did an incredible job of telling us the usefulness of missions to Venus would be if we could potentially land humans to explore the planet, and where the studies could take us as an intelligent species.',\n",
       " \"Dear Principal,\\n\\nI believe that policy 1 is the best policy to enforce about cell phones. This policy will allow us to contact our parents or friends if needed. The use of cell phones in class is wrong but having them during lunch will not cause disruptions. Cell phones can be an annoyance during class but having them when not in class is perfectly acceptable.\\n\\nCell phones are disruptive to teachers and other students during class. If a phone goes off while others are trying to learn it interrupts their attention and annoys the teacher. However having cell phones during lunch or free periods would not disrupt any learning because you are not in a classroom. As long as cell phones are turned off and not being used during class time I see no reason why students should not be allowed to have them.\\n\\nIf a student gets sick or needs something having a cell phone with them can let them call home to contact someone. Even though they can call from the office having a cell phone on hand is a quicker and easier way to contact somebody. Also if a student has some kind of after school practice and can't have their phone with them at school then they won't be able to let their parent know if practice is running late or will finish early. Cell phones are necessary for students to have.\\n\\nPolicy 2 states that students can not have phones at school at all. If you choose policy 2 then students will still bring their phones and use them even more. Teenagers do what they are told not to do. If you tell us we can't have our phones that will just make us want to have them more. Policy 2 will just create more cell phone usage at school and more disruptions to the learning environment.\\n\\nAs you can see I believe that policy 1 is the best policy to enforce at this school. It will let students have their phones outside of class and they can have them if they need to contact some one. Even though cell phones are a nuisance to class this policy only lets you have them when you are not in class. Cell phones are necessary for contacting a parent or just for texting a friend. This is why policy 1 is the best policy for our school.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME\",\n",
       " \"The future. Everyone wonders what it will look like, what it will be like but that is up to our future generations . The young people today will eventually be our future. They will be the ones we look up to for solutions and ideas. By having extracurricular activities be a must in schools we are only making school systems better and by making school systems better we are making our future better. There are so many fun yet different extracurricular activities\\xa0for everyone such as dance, student council or debate. Schools should make participating in an extracurricular activity mandatory for students\\xa0because it will give the students a chance to explore their passions, it will provide them an opportunity to make life-long friends and it will benefit the schools participating.\\n\\nScientist, doctor, musician, teacher...the list for jobs goes on and on. Through this program students will be able to figure out what their passion is and what career they want to have. By providing students the chance to participate in extracurricular activities, you are letting them get a head-start in life. By trying out different activities, they will be able to determine which one they like the most and want to pursue as a career. Many students in high school\\xa0still don't know what career path they want to pursue, but students who had to do an extracurricular will already know which one they prefer to others. Thus, they won't be puzzled by the time they have to choose a career. Additionally, participating in extracurricular activities will help strengthen their resume when they need it. A student who has done multiple extracurricular activities will be preferred to another student who has not done any. Furthermore, my sister, Generic_Name, never knew what career she wanted to pursue until she took a building class as an extracurricular in 9th grade. She instantly fell in love with it and could use that extracurricular class as a bonus on her resume. She is now in her first year at Yale, studying engineering. This shows why extracurricular activities will help students discover their passion.\\n\\nIf this program is put in place, students will have a chance to meet new people and make lots of friends that share similar interests. Every year, many new kids will move to the area and come to a new school so providing an additional way to get to know others is needed. The new kid will be able to connect with others that share similar interests and it will make the whole moving process much easier. In addition, having a friend that shares the same interests as you will make your bond much stronger and make you much better friends. This program will also benefit shy kids or students who are more quiet and reserved. It will help them because in school they might be more quiet if they don't feel comfortable or if none of the subjects interest them. However, if they are in an environment where they enjoy what they are doing and are with\\xa0people like them they will be more likely to branch out. When I was nine, my school required I do a sport. Thus, I decided to do swim team. When I started the sport I was new to town. We had just moved from California to Virginia so I did not have many friends. However, I made many friends quite easily because of swim team. I made friends faster than usual since we shared similar interests. We all liked swimming and we would all have friendly competitions. We even took trips together which made our bond even stronger. We helped each other\\xa0through hard times. Even though, two of my friends from swim team switched schools I am still very close friends with all of them. The bond we created will last a life time.\\n\\nHaving kids do at least one extracurricular activity will benefit schools\\xa0in many ways.\\n\\nIt will keep students busy and occupied; thus, they won't get into trouble as much. I was once told that if you are bored, it\\xa0can often lead to trouble because if you're busy you have no time to make trouble.\\n\\nAlso, by having students do extracurricular activities it will seem as if the school gives off lots of well rounded students who have many skills. This will seem very impressive. Lastly, the school's students will most likely have a higher grade point average (GPA) and better scores in general compared to schools who don't require extracurricular activities. This is because\\xa0studies show that students who do extracurricular activities\\xa0such as sports or clubs have done better in academics and will learn time management and balance better than other kids. This is why enforcing extracurricular\\xa0activities will improve schools.\\n\\nIn conclusion, schools should adopt a new policy of having students preform at least one extracurricular activity. This is a great way to help students find their passion, make new friends and better the schools. Students will be to find an extracurricular that sparks interest for them and hopefully it will turn out to be their career. They will also be able to make strong friendships through this program. It will also ease the anxiety of making friends for new kids. Lastly, the program will benefit\\xa0schools by making their students more well rounded, increasing the overall GPA of their students and help keep students occupied and out of trouble after school. In fact, all schools in America should decide to make this a requirement. Not only will it make our school systems better but it will also improve our students; which are our future. The students in our schools today will eventually become leaders, officials, activists, doctors, lawyers, actors and politicians. So if this program will better schools and the lives that hold our future then there should be no question about implementing it.\\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\",\n",

You also should keep this as a school policy because you shouldn't be able to participate if you are either failing a class or struggling to pass that class you need you won't be able to have any ability to do so in school sports and all. The student is just taking the class for nothing if he/she is failing just to be in a sport and that they don't care about their grade. He/she needs to keep a B average to be able to participate for that gain of socializing and gaining special abilities.\\n\\nAs I student myself think that I keep a pretty good grade average and with my other students who are C averages students should also have help keeping a B average. I would love to start a tutoring club to help them, but some students may just be to stubborn to admit they need help then that will lead to the kicking off the team or club. So, I think we should urge students to come if they need help or at least want to stay on the team or club.\\n\\nThank you for listening to my reason of who you should make that a school policy. I am all for your decision. Have a nice day and thanks again.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME\",\n",
       " 'Libraries have been a crucial part of our society for centuries, providing access to knowledge and information for people of all ages. However, with the rise of digital technology, some people argue that libraries are no longer necessary. In this essay, I will argue for the continued importance of libraries in the digital age, highlighting their unique role in promoting literacy, preserving history, and fostering community.\\n\\nFirstly, libraries play a vital role in promoting literacy and reading habits, especially among children. While e-books and digital resources have become more accessible, research has shown that children who read physical books are more likely to develop better reading skills and a deeper appreciation for literature. Libraries offer a wide range of books that cater to different reading levels and interests, which helps to foster a love for reading among children. Furthermore, libraries often host storytime sessions, book clubs, and other literacy programs that help to develop reading skills and encourage a love for books.\\n\\nSecondly, libraries are essential in preserving history and culture. They collect, catalog, and preserve materials that are valuable to researchers, historians, and the general public. For example, libraries often house rare books, manuscripts, and archives that provide insight into our past. These resources are crucial for understanding our cultural heritage and the events that have shaped our society. Moreover, libraries often host exhibitions, lectures, and workshops that showcase the history and culture of our communities, making them important institutions for preserving our collective memory.\\n\\nThirdly, libraries have evolved to meet the changing needs of their communities in the digital age. They now offer a range of digital resources, including e-books, databases, and online courses, that are accessible to patrons remotely. This means that people can access library resources from anywhere, regardless of their location or socio-economic status. Libraries also provide computer and internet access to those who may not have these resources at home, ensuring that everyone has equal access to information and opportunities for learning.\\n\\nFourthly, libraries foster a sense of community and collaboration among their patrons. They offer shared spaces for studying, meeting, and collaborating, which helps to promote social connections and a sense of belonging. Libraries also host author talks, book clubs, and other events that bring people together and encourage discussion and debate. These events help to build a sense of community and foster a love for learning that goes beyond the classroom.\\n\\nFinally, libraries are cost-effective and accessible to everyone. They provide a range of services and resources that would otherwise be unaffordable for many people. For example, libraries offer free access to books, movies, and music, which can be expensive for individuals to purchase. Additionally, libraries often provide programs and services that cater to specific communities, such as children with special needs or seniors who may be isolated. By providing these services, libraries help to promote social equity and inclusion, making them essential institutions in our society.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while the rise of digital technology has transformed the way we access information, libraries continue to play a vital role in promoting literacy, preserving history, and fostering community. They offer unique resources and services that are still relevant and important in the digital age. Therefore, I argue that libraries are just as important today as they have been in the past, and that they will continue to be essential institutions for generations to come.',\n",
       " \"As an eighth-grade student, I strongly believe that the school board should not add more time to the school hours. While it may seem like a good idea to give students more time to learn, there are several reasons why this would not be beneficial.\\n\\nFirstly, adding more time to the school day would mean that students would have less time to complete their homework. Many students already struggle to keep up with their workload, and giving them even more time would only make things worse. This would put a lot of pressure on students to complete their assignments, which could lead to stress and burnout.\\n\\nSecondly, many students have plans after school that they look forward to. Whether it's going to a sporting event, meeting with friends, or pursuing a hobby, these activities are an important part of a student's life. Adding more time to the school day would mean that students would have less time to do these things, which could lead to feelings of frustration and disappointment.\\n\\nThirdly, some students may have to go somewhere after school, such as to a part-time job or to take care of their siblings. Adding more time to the school day would mean that these students would have to find a way to fit in their after-school responsibilities, which could be difficult and stressful.\\n\\nFinally, some students may find themselves feeling bored in class. While it's important to keep students engaged in their studies, adding more time to the school day would not necessarily solve this problem. If students are feeling bored, it's likely because the curriculum is not challenging or interesting to them. Adding more time to the school day would not make the curriculum any better, and could even make things worse by causing students to feel more disengaged.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while the idea of adding more time to the school day may seem like a good one, there are several reasons why this would not be beneficial. Students already struggle to keep up with their workload, and adding more time would only make things worse. Students have plans and responsibilities outside of school that they look forward to, and adding more time to the school day would mean that they would have less time to enjoy these things. Some students may find themselves feeling bored in class, and adding more time would not make the curriculum any better.

       " \"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person for different opinions. It is a good thing to ask different people on their advice about a certain topic, because one person might say one thing but it might not be the best advice for you. So if you ask several people you can see what might be right for you to do.\\n\\nSay you ask one person and you ask them if you should propose to someone and they really don't what your saying and they just say yes. Well if you told him that you just wanted their money and didn't really like the person for who they are. The guy said you should propose so you do and you end up getting divorced. But if you would of asked someone else's opinion they could have told you that you should not be doing this and it wont work out in the end.\\n\\nHere is some other examples. If you want to know if you should get a certain gift for someone on their birthday it is good to ask people that know the person. Like if their a girl you can ask if they are into dolls or if they really like volleyball and get them a new volleyball to play with. Another example is if your at the store and its your first time shopping for avocados, you want to know which one to buy so you ask the person next to you. they say they prefer their avocado to be hard but still a little soft. You then go ask another person and they say they like theirs hard. You know have an idea on what avocado to get for the next time you go shopping.\\n\\nWhen people ask for advice it is a great thing to ask for different opinions because it can really help with the outcome of what ever you need.   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\",\n",
       " 'The debate over the legalization of marijuana has been ongoing for quite some time now. While some people argue that it should be legalized, others believe that it should remain illegal. In my opinion, marijuana should be legalized.\\n\\nFirstly, the legalization of marijuana would generate significant revenue for the government through taxation. This revenue could be used to fund various programs such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure development. For example, in states where marijuana has been legalized, such as Colorado and California, the government has collected millions of dollars in tax revenue.\\n\\nSecondly, legalizing marijuana would reduce the number of people incarcerated for drug-related offenses. According to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), over 8 million people were arrested for marijuana-related offenses between 2001 and 2010. Legalizing marijuana would reduce the burden on the criminal justice system and allow law enforcement to focus on more serious crimes.\\n\\nFurthermore, marijuana has been shown to have medicinal properties and can be used to treat a variety of conditions, such as chronic pain, anxiety, and epilepsy. Legalizing marijuana would make it easier for patients to access this medication and improve their quality of life.\\n\\nOn the other hand, opponents of marijuana legalization argue that it could lead to an increase in drug use and addiction. However, studies have shown that legalization does not necessarily lead to an increase in drug use. In fact, a study conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that legalization in some states actually led to a decrease in opioid overdose deaths.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the benefits of legalizing marijuana far outweigh the potential drawbacks. It would generate revenue for the government, reduce the number of people incarcerated for drug-related offenses, and provide patients with access to medicinal marijuana. Therefore, I strongly believe that marijuana should be legalized.',\n",

       " \"Working with a group can have numerous benefits, both in terms of learning and cultural exchange. When individuals come together to work towards a common goal, they can share their unique perspectives and skills to achieve something greater than what any one person could do alone. For example, in a group project for school, each member can contribute their own area of expertise, such as research, writing, or design, to create a comprehensive and well-rounded final product.\\n\\nIn terms of learning, working with a group can be incredibly effective. When individuals are able to collaborate and share their knowledge, they can learn from each other and gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter. This is especially true when group members come from diverse backgrounds and experiences, as they can bring different viewpoints and approaches to the table. By working together, group members can challenge each other's ideas and learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\nWorking with a group can also facilitate cultural exchange between members. When individuals from different cultures come together, they can share their customs, traditions, and values with each other, promoting mutual understanding and respect. This can be especially important in today's globalized world, where cultural exchange and understanding are more important than ever.\\n\\nAnother benefit of working with a group is the development of communication and language skills. When individuals work together, they must learn to communicate effectively and listen to each other's perspectives. This can help to improve their language skills, as they learn to express themselves clearly and understand each other's ideas. Additionally, working with a group can help individuals to develop their critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as they learn to work together to overcome challenges and obstacles.\\n\\nFinally, working with a group can provide a sense of support and motivation. When individuals are working towards a common goal, they can encourage and motivate each other to reach their full potential.

The Google Cars must have an alert driver when driving. The Google Car cannot pull in and out of driveways. When dealing with road contrustion or navigating through an accident, the driver must take over then as well. The BMW, \"Traffic Jam Assistant,\" can reach speeds up to 25 miles per hour, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel.

       " \"Getting advice from others helps you in many ways. Sometimes it may be hard to make decisions alone, and asking for other opinions is a good idea. Most of the time, the person you ask for advice from will be more responsible, have a clearer perspective, and may have even experienced the same problem as you. All in all, asking peers and adults for advice leads you to make a better choice than you would have if you hadn't asked for their opinions.\\n\\nAsking friends for advice helps you gain a new perspective on your situation. Since other people aren't in in your shoes, they will be less biased when deciding what to do. I was once in a fight with my friend Generic_Name. I had told her a secret, and she was the only person I had told. When I found out that other people knew my secret, I was angry and decided to stop talking to Generic_Name completely. I assumed that she was to blame for telling others my secret. I missed having Generic_Name to talk to, but still couldn't believe she let out my secret. I decided to ask Generic_Name, a mutual friend of Generic_Name and I, for advice. After telling Generic_Name what had happened, she gave me her view on the situation. She told me that maybe someone had overheard me when I was telling Generic_Name my secret. I thought about it, and realized that this was likely what happened. I was being so stubborn and wasn't very open-minded about the situation because I had immediately assumed that Generic_Name had betrayed me. Generic_Name's advice was very helpful because she had a different perspective on what happened. The next day, I confirmed that Generic_Name's suspicions were true, and apologized to Generic_Name. If I hadn't asked Generic_Name for advice, I don't think I would have found out what really happened.\\xa0An additional benefit of hearing the opinions of others is that they can help you make more responsible decisions.\\n\\nIt is important to ask adults for advice because they are more mature. Parents and elders can help you make smarter decisions that will help you for the future. A study done by Harvard University examined the brains of a 14-year old and a 40-year old. They discovered that the frontal lobe, which helps with decision making, was significantly more developed in the 40-year old than the teenager. They concluded that adults in general will think about the both the long- and short-term effects of the choice, while teenagers are likely to just make the more appealing decision for themselves in the present. For example, if asked to go out to a party, a teenager would say yes because they think that it will make them more popular. Now, if the teenager asked the adult if they could go to this party, the adult would take into account that the party would prevent the teenager from studying for an important test, and they would tell the teenager not to go. The adult's decision is much more practical for the future, while the teenager's decision will only benefit them for a short amount of time. Asking an adult for advice is also helpful because they may have been in the same situation as you before.\\n\\nAdults are wiser and more experienced than kids. They have seen more issues and also have a better idea of how to solve them. One time, my cousin, Generic_Name, had to make a decision on whether or not he should join the school track team. He knew that it would be a fun experience, but also knew it would be very time-consuming. Generic_Name was also a member of both the soccer and football teams. He decided to ask his dad for advice since his dad had also been a high school\\xa0athlete. His dad's advice helped Generic_Name with his decision. His dad told him that he had participated in three high school sports, and that he wished he hadn't. As a student, he struggled constantly and never had enough time to go to sports practice and finish his homework. Generic_Name's father also said that he only got about 5 hours of sleep each night. Generic_Name was glad that he had asked his dad for help. He decided not to do track after hearing his dad's advice. The previous experience of Generic_Name's dad helped Generic_Name to not make the same mistake. If Generic_Name hadn't sought out his dad's opinion, he would have struggled to do his schoolwork and would be tired during the school day. It is important to ask people for advice because most of them have already experienced many of the issues that you will go through.\\n\\nWhen struggling to make a decision, hearing the advice of others is vital. Friends and family members can help you make smarter, more responsible decisions that will help you in the long-run. The reason that asking others is so beneficial is because they have a different perspective, are more mature, and have also been in more situations than you. The next time you have to make a choice, the best thing to do is to seek for the advice of others.\",\n",

Not most people have vehicals because of the payment range and if we can change that who knows we might not have to have buses, taxi, etc any more, and the people will have more money to take care of their children and its also gonna help with car crashes and lowering how many we have every year or so. Allowing kids16+ to drive the less crashes will help majorly. Also with the insureance itll cost less but will the insurance go out of buisness ?

It\\'s way easier than trying to write everything down on a piece of paper or risk forgetting important dates. 😅 Plus, we can use our phones to look up information and resources for our projects and presentations. It\\'s like having a tiny computer in our pockets! 💻\\n\\nAnother advantage is that it helps us learn new things! 🤓 We can use our phones to access educational apps, watch educational videos, and even take online courses! 🎉 It\\'s like having a personal learning assistant in our pockets! 🤓 And let\\'s be real, sometimes it\\'s easier to learn something on our phones than it is to try to pay attention in class. 😅\\n\\nBut, there are also some disadvantages to allowing students to use their phones during school hours. 📉 For one, it can be super distracting! 😴 Like, who hasn\\'t gotten sucked into scrolling through Instagram or playing games during class? 🙋\\u200d♀️ It can be hard to focus on the lesson when there are so many fun things to see and do on our phones! 😅 And, let\\'s be real, some students might use their phones to cheat or bully others. 😔 That\\'s not cool, guys! 🙅\\u200d♀️\\n\\nSo, what do I think? 🤔 I think we',\n",
       " \"Summer break is a time every student and teacher look forward to and count the days until it arrives. However, one of the things that many students dread is summer projects. Summer projects could be assigned by all or just a few classes. They can be from reading a book to writing 3 essays about the subject. These assignments are often only designed by teachers but it is time for a change. Summer projects created by students would be better for their academical, social, and mental prosperity.\\n\\nTo start with, if students were to create these assignments, academic learning would be more accurate and necessary. Often times teachers can create projects that aren't accurate to what students really need to practice and focus on. A student best knows what their struggles and weaknesses are thus making assignments that help those weaknesses more accurate. The projects would be a accurate representation of what they need to work on. For example, if most of the students were struggling on one aspect of geometry, they would create a project that focuses on that. Plus, if the students really wanted to improve, the project would be more likely to get done. A lot of the times students do not do these summer assignments because they feel like it is unnecessarily difficult. A good amount of these projects are just long busy work that the students are very unlikely to complete. If students were to make them though, there would be no complaints about it being unnecessary. Overall, student-designed projects avoid inaccurate and unnecessary factors. Also, not only do they help academically, but socially as well.\\n\\nAdditionally, self-made projects would make room for social time and priorities. It is important to have free time with friends and family so students maintain a social life. Social lives are important because humans are social creatures and tend to not do well without interactions. This social life is often difficult to keep up with when a student is locked up in their room doing these consuming projects and assignments that do not even help them. Family time is also being limited by these assignments. Sometimes the only time a student can see their family is during the summer. Take for instance divorced parents who only get to see their child every once and a while and one of those times being summer. Also, priorities such as jobs can be jeopardized. Students a lot of the times have full time jobs over the summer that require a lot of their time. Thus, they will not always have time to do their work. However, if these students were to make their own projects they can account for their schedule. Consequentially, having this social freedom helps with students mentally.\\n\\nSome teachers might say that their assignments are made to help students and there is no excuse to not completing them. However, a lot of them do not factor in the fact that it is not only their assignment the student has to worry about but multiple. This could cause mental strain that overwhelms and overworks a student. The overload of work causes serious stress for a student. This stress is an actual issue that can even cause physical problems such as getting sick. Thus stress can hinder their ability to work effectively. Everyone has a limit to what they can do including these students.\\n\\nAll together, student-designed projects could benefit them in several ways. To start, they are accurate and necessary representations of what the student needs. Also, they can be designed to free up time for family, friends, and jobs that help maintain a social life. Thus, avoiding the mental strain and stress that comes with the overload of teacher-designed assignments. Summer break provides a well deserved rest to students and faculty\\xa0and should not be any harder than it needs to be.   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   \\xa0\\xa0\",\n",
       " 'Plan My claim would have to be that computers who identify human emotions would be a valubale thinkg because many students come to class felling down or sad sometimes and instead of them keeping i to them selves.\\n\\nSomebody would hopefully be kind enough and ask if there doing okay or if they need somebody to talk to instead of just having to go thruogh it them selves, just like a child going thru depresion at the end of the day you want to look for those children and help them. But another think would be why would we need this in class instead of using money for this technology they should fix the schools and bring more learning experiences around the country instead of wasting money to see how somebody is feeling youll make somebody happy by just saying have a wonderful day today like the person grading this test i hope you have a wonderful day and i hope at the end of the day i pass this because its a big part of high school and im clearly not the smartest student but at the end of the day i get what i have to do done and dont complain but this invension would be a good project to go around at the airport or banks just to see peoples reaction when they walk in and as there going out to see the diffrence of there face reactions. the mona lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile while it shows how much this computer can do,imagine a computer that knows when youre happy or sad, thatll be really creapy once it knows how you\\'re feeling.\\n\\nLIke example \"if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow. but if you frown the next ad will be different.\" this sounds good so when you want certain kind of apps to pop up but once the system knows how youre feeling is another thing instead of seeing how im feeling they should help out people in need who need the help to help them keep there emotions better, Also crazy how theis technology would make it easy for a computer to recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored. My claim would have to be that I would wan this in my class or around my school beacuse i personaly feel like many students will come into school with a diffrent mood if they knew there expresions or feelings are all being detected, instead of them coming sad theyll probabaly chear up a bit since they maybe dont want anybody to know how there feeling and itll try to hid it and change there mood from what it was at first. This process all beigins with a computer that constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, all 44 major muscles in the model unit must move like a human muscles. Some coding system facial expressions that its going to be able to read is six basic emotions like happiness,surprise, anger, disgust, fear ,and sadness, many people are not gonna like the idea of this beause people don want to let everbody know what they are feeling or what there thinking of.

There are many pros to a driverless car, if the cars can be made and used then they could help give parents and kide more freedomes. Driverless cars can help with safety on the roads.\\n\\nDriverless cars could give parents and kids more freedom. They could do this by allowing the parents more free time, because they wouldnt have to find the time out of their schudule to drive their child to a friends house or to a move. The car could pick up the kids and then the kids could text or call their parent to let them know that they have gotten to the place safe. This could also help with being on time, The car would come around the time that it was told so kids would not be able to say they were late because they lost track of time. For the kids, they would have more time to make plans and to hang out with friends. They wouldnt have to wait on a parent to get to their house to pick them up, because their parent is at work. The cars could also help with car pooling if needed they could find the fastest rute to pick up everyone in the group. These are some of the reasons that driverless cars could give parent and kids more freedom.\\n\\nDriverless cars could also help with safety. For example it would help with drunk driving. The cars are driverless so the intoxenanated person would not be driving, and it would get the person home safely and without putting other people in danger. These cars could also help in dangerous weather, instead of people driving the same speeds in bad weather the car could take them a good speed for the condutions on the road.\\n\\nDriverless cars give parents and kids more free time and can help keep the roads safe. Kids could do more things with their friends, parents could have somemore time to themselves relaxing at home, there would be a decrease in drunk drivers, and it would help keep people safe in bad weather.

When you ask other people, they will tell you their story, and you will get an honest opinion on what would work for you.

People use more opinions to to filter them out. They have all these opinions, maybe they are all the same, maybe none of them are the same.

There is another good thing about asking for more than one opinion.\\n\\nAnother reason is to sort those opinions out and move them around. When you have like seven or eight opinions, it is hard to use all eight of them. Sometimes you can smush all of your opinions into one.

       " 'In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents and how he was saying different things about how Venus is and was shows that he really does have an interest in studying Venus and he defends his argument well because he goes into detail on what he wants to do and what he wants to know.\\n\\nAlthough the passage is having to do with exploring Venus theres nothing much said about them doing things because they failed multiple times and by the looks of it I don\\'t think its going to happen because of how the author talks about Venus.\\n\\nThe author seems to be doing everything he could to actually try to explore Venus despite the difficulties they are having, that even if it is dangerous the author will still try to do something about it.\\n\\nIn my opinion I think what the author\\'s doing is very dangerous because he doesn\\'t know what the outcome is going to be, it could go both good and bad because there is a possibility that anything can happen, as said in the article though, they are only looking at sending technology to try to explore Venus not humans so it wouldn\\'t be as dangerous and I think thats why the author is still open on exploring it and not giving up so he can try to find some answers to what hes been questioning.\\n\\nIn the last paragraph (8) the author states that the challenge presented by Venus has value because of human curiosity because it will lead them into many equally intimidating endeavors and just basically saying to think of it as an imagination but at the same time something you can do and want to achieve.\\n\\nIn conclusion if the author thinks that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit then that\\'s what hes going to go for, some people are also curious on that and so the author trying to do that will be helpful to others and himself and if he does succeed others will be satisfied with what the author came up with besides the dangers the study presents I do think that it will all be worth it at the end of the day, because that\\'s a goal they\\'ve been trying to accomplish for sometime now.

       " 'Many elections have passed throughout the years. When its time to vote people go out crazy just to cast in their vote. They are hoping that the candidate they selected gets nominated and win. The Electoral College is a method to elect presidents which in some way its a good thing. The way i see it its not, so i claim to change the way presidents are elected by changing to election by popular vote rather than the Electoral College because it is unfair. Also, its not really you who is being a part of which president you chose to win. Last of all, its a waste of time.\\n\\nTo start off the Electoral College should be replaced with election by popular vote because it is unfair for the most part. The Electoral College has its good part which states in source 3, paragraph 22 \" In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep your despised method of choosing president\" \" The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.\" It shows how it helps with the majority votes. Yet it is more unfair as it states in source 2 paragraph 12 \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong\" \"Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, he election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote the president.\" This shows how if there is ever a tie then really your vote doesnt count since someone else has to end up deciding who to elect for president.\\n\\nIf we were to elect presidents by popular vote then it would be more fair since we are electing them with our votes.\\n\\nFollowing how the Electoral College is unfair, it also shows how we really dont elect the president. In source 2 paragraph 10 it states \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" This shows how our votes go to their electors rather than us electing the president. That is not a good way to count our votes because you never know if the elector is in favor or not with their candidate. Also, the electors could be anyone as it says in source 2 paragraph 10 \" They can be anyone not holding public office.\" We never know if the electors are reliable and it can affect some people since they voted for that specific candidate to be president and they didnt get enough votes when in reality its between their electors and states. It just shows how in reality our votes dont really have a say and count in the way where we don\\'t elect the president.\\n\\nNot only is the Electoral College unfair and it really doesn\\'t let us elect the president, it also is a waste of time. It\\'s good how the Electoral College has steps and takes time to go through the motions of how many votes and who does the electors vote for and all, but it takes a whole lot time for nothing really. The election is really not with our votes, but between the state, House of Representative , and their electors. It just waste time as in source 2 paragraph 12 it says \" Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives. where state delegations vote on the president. The Senate would choose the vice president. Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming. representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House\\'s selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.\" This shows how it takes a long time within just them when we just waste our tim with voting since they would have the last word.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I claim on changing to election by popular vote than keeping the Electoral College because it is unfair. You arent really the one choosing the president, you are choosing their electors. At the end of the day its a waste of time for us to vote and to go through all those steps with the Electoral College and wait to see who gets elected. The Electoral College in a way shows how our vote doesnt really have a say and count directly towards the president. It is much better if the election would be by popular vote since it is us electing and we know who we voted and all. This way it let\\'s us speak through our votes.',\n",
       " 'The works of a car have created wonders to people as early as the early 1900s. Now people need to understand the advatages of limting car use. Pollution has gone down in cities from not using cars and people have reported less stress, which is due to the car rates going down. Many people have argued that jobs are going to go more down then we may need, if we stop using cars, but there is always a way to fix small situations such as that.\\n\\nStudies have shown cars have created pollution for the enviornment. Pollution can cause sickness and other affects that can cause a habitat to be inhabitable.\"Pasenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States,\"(Rosenthal,5). Though, we can fix that. Many cities such as Paris,France have experimented with the law involving cars to see if the country can have a pollution decrease and they did, within the first day. Duffer reported that on Monday Paris created a ban for the even-numbered plates and the smog was able to clear in one day\\'s time. \"The smog cleared enough Monay for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday,\" (Duffer,19).\\n\\nPeople have argued that stopping car production may cause people to lose their jobs. There is a way to fix that. Selsky reported that in Bogota,Colombia because of the car distribution slowing down they were able to make parks and sport centers accessiable. \"Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city,\"(Selsky,28). With that being said without people running any of those faclities then parks and sport centers wouldn\\'t be that accessiable to the fellow citizens. So by creating more places like parks and sport centers, and less places like car factories we would be able to limit car usage without the worry of someone losing their job and not being able to get one.\\n\\nCars have also been known to cause stress. In the article \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,\" Rosaenthal quoted Heidrun Walter talking about how tense she was when she had a car. The constant worrying for gas and car bills may be a factor towards the stress in someone\\'s life. Young adults have not worried as much for a car, making the somewhat more content. \"Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver\\'s license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy,\" (Rosenthal,39).\\n\\nLimting car use can cause a major impact on today\\'s society. \"Demographic shifts in driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate,\" (Rosenthal,38). It has many advantages that people should understand. Pollution rates can go down. Stress could go down once you start limting car use.       \\xa0       \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0       \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0       \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0       \\xa0    ',\n",
       " 'Self-esteem is an individual’s opinion of themselves and their worth. It can be influenced by many different sources such as past experiences, family and society. Achievement is also a source of self-esteem. That is, achieving something – whether it be a personal goal or a major victory – can lead to a higher level of self-confidence. \\n\\nFor example, a student who works diligently for a school project and earns a perfect score can gain a boost in their self-esteem. That student may then set larger goals for themselves in the future and feel more capable of meeting challenges. Alternatively, a worker who receives a promotion can feel proud of their success. This positive recognition of their achievement can boost their level of self-worth and lead to higher credibility when trying to achieve future goals. \\n\\nThe process of achieving something can also be a source of self-esteem. Setting goals and objectives and pushing one’s self to achieve them can be a very rewarding experience in terms of self-confidence and self-worth. Achieving something also can involve rewarding yourself for successes. This could be in the form of celebratory treats or taking time for yourself to relax and enjoy the fruits of your hard work. Equally important is being able to recognize your successes, both big and small.\\n\\nIn conclusion, achievement is a great source of self-esteem for many people. Not only does achieving something lead to a higher level of self-confidence and recognition, but the process of committing to and achieving a goal is also a self-esteem booster. Knowing how to reward yourself after achieving something and setting goals appropriately so that they are achievable are also important strategies.',\n",
       " 'Dear Principal,\\n\\nI hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to you today to share my thoughts on the idea of students performing community service.\\n\\nI believe that students should be required to perform community service because it is a great way to give back to our community and help others. It also teaches us the value of hard work and responsibility.\\n\\nSome of my friends already perform community service by tutoring younger children or cleaning up litter. They have told me how fulfilling it is to know that they are making a difference in their community. They have also learned valuable skills such as patience, communication, and problem-solving.\\n\\nOn the other hand, some of my friends do not believe in community service because they think it takes away from their own personal time. However, I disagree with this. Community service is a chance for us to take a break from our own lives and focus on the needs of others. It can also be a fun and rewarding experience, especially when we do it together as a group.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that students should be required to perform community service. It is a great way to give back to our community, teach us valuable skills, and help us become responsible citizens. I hope you will consider my thoughts and make community service a requirement for all students.\\n\\nThank you for your time.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n[Your name]',\n",

       " 'We should keep the Electoral College because it helps the people choose a president easily then just by popular votes. The process that helps the people choose a president is easy thanks to the Electorl College.\\xa0According to the source 1 \"The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.\" (source 1).\\n\\nThe process for Electoral College is very simple for our Nation.

       " 'Have you ever wondered how someone close to you was feeling, at any moment of the day? This new Facial Action Coding System can help you do exactly that. The system will be useful in many ways, but I think it can be very useful in the everyday classroom. Teachers have always wondered how their students were feeling at all times during their lesson, and this software can help them reach out to their students tremendously. It can help with their lesson plan, their attitude, and their teaching style, making it a good work environment for the students.\\n\\nTeachers make a lesson plan for the week and it can change depending on the circumstances. Imagine being a teacher and being able to read the students\\' faces an emotions. In paragraph 6, it states that \"the software can recognize when a student is becoming bored or confused.\" This can allow teachers to analyze the situation in which the classroom is in. If the students are generally happy, then you can go along teaching and educating them the same way as you did before. Now, what if the students were not so enthused about your lectures? If the students show a monotone facial expression, or maybe a bored and sad one, then it might be due time to go and fix your mistakes, make the plan more exciting, and get them excited about learning. This can improve their confidence and allow them to have a bright future.\\n\\nThe way students act in class often create a chain reaction, making the teachers either pleased or digruntled with the way the students behave. If the teachers can read their expressions, change their lesson plan, and create a greatly improved learning environment, then everyone can go home happy. The students will listen more intently and the teachers will not have such a hard time dealing with their attitudes. In this scenario, everyone can get along well together and enjoy their time in the classroom.\\n\\nIn paragraph 3, it states that the software can \"classify six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear, and sadness.\" Picking up these emotions on a student can change the way a learning environment works. If the student is showing signs of negative facial expressions and emotions, then the teacher can alter their style of teaching. They can create a warm and fun learning environment for the pupils, which can lead to them successfully gaining the knowledge they need to move on in life. The way a student acts in the classroom can affect many others around them and their attitude towards learning. If a teacher can detect even the slightest bit of negativity in the classroom, they can stop the spread and do their best to make learning fun and relatable for the students.\\n\\nThis new software could be innovative for the way classrooms work in the future. If students could be educated the way they would want to be educated, yet still get the knowledge they need to succeed, then the future generation could be unstoppable. In paragraph 9 it states that \"making faces can reveal so much about the science of emotions.\" There are no limits to what the next generation can do if it all starts with teachers being able to read the emotions of their students. The future starts here with this idea, and this software. ',\n",
       " '[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, Zip]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[State Senator\\'s Name]\\n[State Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, Zip]\\n\\nSubject: The Importance of Retaining the Electoral College\\n\\nDear [State Senator\\'s Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my support for retaining the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. The Electoral College, as established by our founding fathers, is a compromise between direct election by popular vote and election by Congress. Although many argue for changing to a popular vote system, I believe that keeping the Electoral College is essential for several reasons.\\n\\nFirstly, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome. In an election where disputes can arise, the winner of the Electoral College vote consistently achieves a greater share of electoral votes than their share of popular votes. This reduces the likelihood of a disputed outcome, as demonstrated by the 2012 election where President Obama received a higher proportion of electoral votes compared to his popular vote share.\\n\\nSecondly, the Electoral College promotes the concept of \"everyone\\'s president.\" As no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, candidates are pushed to cultivate trans-regional appeal. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on winning states that they are confident of winning, which would leave residents of other regions feeling disenfranchised.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states. By using a winner-take-all system, candidates are motivated to concentrate their efforts on toss-up states, where voters pay close attention to the campaign and are more likely to make thoughtful decisions. This ensures that the most informed voters, who have received substantial attention and information from the candidates, have a significant influence in deciding the election\\'s outcome.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College provides balance between large and small states. While the Senate\\'s mal-apportionment can lead to an imbalance in political weight, the Electoral College restores some of this balance. For instance, Florida, a large state, received more attention from presidential candidates in the 2012 elections compared to Wyoming, a small state, despite the popular vote being close in both states. This encourages candidates to address the concerns of citizens in both populous and less populated areas.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate wins a majority of popular votes, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner. This eliminates the necessity and complications of run-off elections, ensuring a smooth and decisive determination of the president.\\n\\nWhile critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters by making their vote seemingly irrelevant, studies show that voter turnout in presidential elections remains high. Voters participate in the elections to express their political preferences, rather than with the expectation that their individual vote will sway the national outcome.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College is a critical institution that preserves the integrity and balance of our democratic process. It guarantees a certain outcome, encourages candidates to appeal to a broader audience, ensures thoughtful voting in swing states, balances the interests of large and small states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. Therefore, I urge you to support keeping the Electoral College to maintain the stability and fairness of our presidential elections.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will consider the significance of the Electoral College in shaping a successful and representative democracy.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]',\n",
       " \"Online classes have become a popular option for students in recent years, offering flexibility and convenience that traditional classroom settings cannot match. However, like any other educational approach, online learning has its pros and cons. In this essay, I will evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of attending classes online, identify the difficulties students may face in this environment, analyze the impact of online learning on students, and examine the potential pitfalls of attending online classes.\\n\\nOne of the significant pros of attending classes online is the flexibility it offers. Students can attend classes from the comfort of their own homes, at any time of the day or night, as long as they have a stable internet connection. This is particularly beneficial for students who have busy schedules, such as athletes, musicians, or those who work part-time jobs. Online classes also provide students with the opportunity to learn at their own pace, which can be particularly helpful for those who need extra time to understand complex concepts.\\n\\nAnother advantage of online classes is the access to a wider range of courses. Students who live in remote areas or those who cannot access traditional classrooms due to financial or geographical constraints can benefit from online classes. Additionally, online classes can provide students with access to renowned instructors and experts from around the world, which can broaden their knowledge and perspectives.\\n\\nHowever, attending classes online also has its difficulties. One of the significant challenges is the lack of face-to-face interaction with instructors and peers. This can make it harder for students to build relationships and collaborate with their peers, which can negatively impact their learning experience. Moreover, online classes can be isolating, and students may feel disconnected from their peers and instructors, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation.\\n\\nAnother difficulty students may face in online classes is the distractions that come with learning from home. Students may find it challenging to stay focused and avoid distractions such as television, social media, and household chores. Additionally, students may struggle with time management, which can lead to missed deadlines and poor performance in classes.\\n\\nThe online learning environment can also have a significant impact on students' motivation and engagement. Without the structure of a traditional classroom, students may find it harder to stay motivated and engaged in their learning. Moreover\",\n",

Through trial and error, ESL students can learn how to best achieve their goals while also gaining greater self-confidence. It can also help them become better problem solvers and effective communicators, further preparing them for future success. \\n\\nFurthermore, research also suggests that setting realistic expectations for ESL students and allowing them to make mistakes go a long way in fostering their confidence and resilience.

Many kids get distracted from schoolwork or very important things and blow it off just because they want to text someone.\\n\\nKids keep getting in trouble in school for texting in class so why not ban the? It also keeps teens away from educational purposes like texting instead of reading.\\n\\nMoreover, I believe it brainwashes the teens to be less active or energized. It also leads to cyber bullying and many other consequences. The most important thing of all is that it keeps them away from their future. Education is everything in our future. It is our water in our plants and is the roar of a lion. If success is what you are planning towards these teens, then you must take away their privilege of using cell phones on school grounds. They will soon realize its for their own good and will starting running towards a successful future.\\n\\nMany say that it is a way of communication, but talking twenty four hours a day is a waste of time and its a waste of success. I know you have your freedom, but I suggest to think of the future and where these teens are going to end up as. We want America to be a proud and successful nation, so why not start small with minor problems with too much use of cell phones.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe to a better start in a united is to make the next generation successful.

       " \"Hey, Mrs. Johnson! \\n\\nI'm super excited to write this essay on why schools should implement a 7-day break after every 2 weeks of schooling. I know, I know, it might seem like a weird idea, but hear me out! 😃\\n\\nFirst of all, let's talk about the long summer break. It's like, super long. Like, 60 days long. And it's great for vacations and stuff, but it's also like, really long. And I know some kids might not have the opportunity to go on vacation or visit their grandparents or anything, so it's not like everyone's on the same page. 🤷\\u200d♀️\\n\\nBut, if we had a 7-day break every 2 weeks, it would be way more manageable. Like, think about it. 2 weeks of school, then a week off to relax and recharge. And then 2 more weeks of school, then another week off. It's like, perfect! 😍\\n\\nSo, here are some possible benefits of this initiative:\\n\\n1. Better grades: Studies show that students who get more breaks throughout the year tend to perform better academically. It's like, our brains need a break to absorb everything we learned, you know? 🤓\\n2. Less stress: I know I'm not the only one who feels stressed out during the last week of school before break. It's like, cramming all this work into a short amount of time, and it's just too much. But, with a 7-day break, we could finish our work and actually enjoy our time off instead of being stressed out. 😩\\n3. More opportunities for extracurriculars: If we had more breaks, we could join more extracurricular activities or clubs. Like, I'm really interested in coding, but I don't have time to join the club because we only have summer break. But, if we had more breaks, I could join the club and actually learn something! 💻\\n4. Better mental health: Taking breaks throughout the year can actually improve our mental health.\",\n",
       " 'Thousands of Americans use their own car or a vehicle as their main transportation in their every day lives. No one seems to look at how cars are actually destroying the environment ,rather then helping it. Mainly since the fuel that is given off from a vehicles engine is effecting the environment in a negative way. In all reality the reason why we as humans use our own vehicles is because its a faster way of transportation and carries us to our destination. This is why limiting car usage will be beneficial money wise and create a healthier environment.\\n\\nReducing the car usage is beneficial to creating a cleaner and safer environment. Not only will this effect the environment but your life as well. According to source 1 it states,\" Passengers cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emission in Europe.\" Based on this fact I can acknowledge the fact of how automobiles can effect the greenhouse. The greenhouse is a cycle in which can have a huge impact on our environment. If we destroy that then that may result in even more damages that are caused now. It also states, \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France , after five days of intensifying smog...\" In result, the smog then continued to places such as Bejing, China. Which I personally would consider to be a horrific thing, considering China is very congested already and is one of the most pollued cities in the world. Some may argue of the fact that car usage is their main way from going to point A to point B , but there is proof that is effecting the cities around us. Experts have concluded that there is about 50 percent car intensive areas located in the United States. This is why car usage should be reduced to have create a better environment.\\n\\nThe suburbs are taking action to create denser cities. The purpose of having denser cities is to have a low suburban life. In source 1 it states, \" In this new approach , stores are placed a walk away, on main street, rather than in malls along some distant highways.\" This experiment will help to encourage more ways to attempt public transportation. For instance, riding your bicycle once in a blue moon. Not only are you saving money but you are preventing less traffic from occurring in your area. Some may argue having a low suburban life can be hard to adapt to but it will provide a safer environment. Especially since you are one step closer to making the world less polluted then it already is. I personally would agree on occasionally using a different way to get to my destination. It will not only benefit me in the long run but also cause less chaos on the road. It also states in the text,\" the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting car \"reduced communties\", and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously.\" This means that the Environmental Agency are starting to promote reducing car in certain communities. Some may argue why is there a need to reduce the amount of cars in a community ,but on the other hand that community may be over populated or congested of cars. If this is so, then this will just have another negative impact of the environment. The purpose of the program is to benefit the area you are and to lessen then the issue of car usages. All in all, the suburbs are taking action to create denser cities.\\n\\nPrograms are also being created to spread the news of Car Free day. The purpose for Care Free day in Bogota , Columbia is a day you participate in to prevent traffic jams. For example, In source 3 it states, \"..millions of Colombians hiked, biked, and skated or took buses to work during a car free day.\" This day isn\\'t ment for people who live in Bogota, Colombia but they are trying to influence this tradition in several other countires. Other may agree of this day being pointless , but I can see this having a huge impact on the world. Sooner or later this day will become a tradition not only in several other countries but also in the United States. it also states in source 3,\" Its a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pulltion, said a bussniessman.\" Especially since it rained on the Car free day this didnt stop nor discourage anyone from participating in the event. The event turned out to be a huge success and reduced the amount of smog that day. In my perspective we are all come together as one to build our community together. It takes more thenone person to have such a huge impact on the world. The goal if to lessen the usage of car to have a positive effect on the environment. The influence of the Car free day is just one step closer to reaching that goal. This will is why programs are being creates to spread the news of Car free day.\\n\\nAfter looking of the causes and effects of limiting car usage , it all comes down to having a big influence on the world. It takes one area such as Bogota, Columbia to have a huge impact. In our every day lives , our car is our main resource for transportation, but this should change. Not only are you capable of helping to have a postive effect on the environment but so am I. This just shows how if we are all willing to come together as a community, we are capable of creating a healthier environment. This is why the world should influence limiting car usage.',\n",
       " 'Technology has changed the way we live our lives. From simple labor-reducing items such as washing machines and computers, to revolutionary communication tools like the Internet and smart phones, technology advances have altered the way we experience the world.\\n\\nOne of the most positive impacts of technology is the fact that it facilitates easier and faster communication between people. In the past, the way to find out information about someone or something was to do research; however today, we can find out almost anything we want to know quickly and even communicate with people regardless of distance. In addition, even mundane tasks such as online banking, grocery shopping, and paying bills can be done quickly and efficiently without ever having to leave the house.\\n\\nUnfortunately, technology also has its downsides. For example, it can lead to an unhealthy sedentary lifestyle, as people often spend large amounts of time on the computer, instead of going outdoors and exercising. Also, spending too much time on digital devices can result in damage to relationships due to less face-to-face time with family and friends. In addition, technology is creating a world of instant gratification, which can lead to feelings of impatience with the non-digital world and can lead to a decrease in motivation and self-regulation.\\n\\nOverall, technology has both positive and negative effects on our lives. It enables us to work more efficiently and communicate more easily; however, it can also lead to unhealthy habits and an overall decrease in motivation. Therefore, it is important to keep a balance between the two, in order to have a healthy and productive lifestyle.',\n",

       " 'Ever wondered how the streets of a very popullated city would look like? For example, Miami. At night Miami is full buildings that stand out in color, and on the highways you can see a whole road full of lights, the thing with these lights is that they are cars, even though they are helpful by getting us from point A to point B, they are the second highest source of pollution in the United States, that is after power plants. The only thing a city like Miami is missing at night is a sky full of bright stars, which that can be done by people not driving to everywhere they go, even if it is one or two blocks away. This whole \"car-free\" thing is become more and more popular all over the world.\\n\\nIn Vauban, Germany a small town, home to 5,500 people have decided to go car-free. \"As a result, 70 percent of Vauban\\'s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here\" (Source 1). 70 percent of the the people is a lot, these streets are completly car-free except in the main thoroughfare and on the edge of the community, if this were to happen to a larger city the nights would be beatiful, and so will the days because you have all the car noise out and instead you have people talking and kids running all around the streets. \"Passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States\" (Souce 1). Miami is a car-intensive area, I know this from personal experince, there is always traffic during the day. I\\'ve been to other places in Florida, not that far from Miami, in Palm Beach at night the amount of starts you see at nights is beautiful and it\\'s something new to see other than in Miami you see 2 to 3 stars. My point here isn\\'t stars, it\\'s how much better the world can be if we all do what this small town in Germany is doing.\\n\\nParis, France. The city of lights home to millions of residents and a landmark for millions of tourists, one would think this city couldn\\'t run without cars, but they made it happen. Paris wanted to clean all the air polution in their city, \"On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31)\" (Source 2). Even though some didn\\'t listen and about 4,000 drivers were fined, that is still very little compared to the entire population of Paris. \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog\" (Source 2). Can you believe that? Traffic was down by 60 perfect in the city of lights, if it can happen there it can happen all around the world, little by little bu we\\'ll get it. Public transportation was free of charge in the city while this car-free thing was going on. One week later the smog had cleared out enough for the ruiling French party to rescind the ban.\\n\\n\"BOGOTA, Colombia - In a program that\\'s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams\" (Source 3). Yes, the city of Bogota in Colombia had its one car-free day, in Bogota called \"Day Without Cars\", this was the third year actually, on this \"car-free\" day cars are banned and only buses and taxis are permitted for the day. Bogota was not the only Colombian city to participate in this event, other Colombian cities like Cali and Valledupr, participated in this event for the first time. I find it funny and ironic because my sister has a friend who is Colombian and she owns a bicycle and she goes everywhere in that bicycle, and she refuses to get a car. Bogota is a very known city and just like I said before, if they can do it then the whole world can it. This day should be world wide and should be done at leats twice a year. Events like this will also get people motivated to start walking morre often. \"Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restuarants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up\" (Source 3). If you\\'ve ever been to Miami, you know the huge amount of building there are here and I think there are about 3 or 4 being built at I type, how about we stop there and make Miami and healthier and more environmentally friendly place.\\n\\nIn the United States, research shows \"A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009\" (Source 4). This meaning that adolescents aren\\'t as intresting and driving as they were before, yeah I see how driving can be better but most kids here take the bus, they aren\\'t even driven by their parents anymore. I find that this is a good thing because, one can ask themselves, I can\\'t make a difference, but if thousands of people ask themselves that, then yes a difference can be made. In 2005 the miles driven by Americans peaked, and then steadily went dropping, in April, 2013 they found out that the miles in car was the same as it was in 1995. Not driving everywhere you go and actually walking there is a good thing because you can make new friends, and health wise it is also good because, instead of walking around your block for an hour, you can walk to someones house or to the store. There are several carpooling apps on the internet nowadays, if your friends can\\'t pick you up, for just a push of a button you can have someone come pick you up to where ever you are and drop you off where you need to go to, for a low price. \"Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by\" (Source 4). This means that people aren\\'t as interest in driving anymore, which means we are slowly getting near the time where we\\'ll see more stars in the sky in car-intensive areas.       \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0    ',\n",

This Facial Action Coding system can prevent suicide.\\n\\nEveryone will not think this program is safe, and is envading privacy.\\n\\nBut, this system can save suicidal people from all over the world.

       " \"Do our character have to be formed by that way the we performed or by influences. Your character will be what yourself choose to make it. We should formed our character by influences beyond our control.\\n\\nIn addition, by the influences that we receive day by day we chooses how to be creating our character. For example, I introduced my character in the situations the I pass, that help me how to be a better person. Also, sometimes we take our family advice, they tried to persuade our character by doing incorrect things. In others words we can said that they just want to influences our self because they ready pass for al this things that is good because we can see how much love they have to us. Is wonderful when your mom tell you the she can't believe that way the you get influences because sometimes we don't want to get they advice but all that they said is correct event if we don't want to believe then. For example my parent always want the betters things to me but i know if i don't try to fix my character I going to have less opportunities to have a better job or a better future. Also, Things are necessary somethings is hart to change our character because we think the we are okay but other think all the appositive, so we never have to think the we are fine because the never is going to happened always we have to be better in some thing we need to be honest with our lives and accept what we are doing wrong is more better to accept our errors and there is went we are going to see how our character change in a better way and then we are going to feel happy about our character and our lives.\\n\\nMoreover, The influences control our character by the way the we act and think. For example, I was a person the if something I don't like I really have to talk to you the was horrible. Also my mom help me to change my character in my way to act because went sometimes people tell me things the I really don't like I do bad faces to then, I was doing bad with that. In other way, we don't think in the consequences of having a bad character, sometimes we don't think if others are going to see the actions in our lives and they maybe are going to influences you but no we the same attitude, because some people have bad attitude to but all the influences help you in life because if you don't like the people act with a bad attitude you don't have to be like that to. Also, you have to be prepared to make the decisions of what changes you are going to make. Having a good character gives you large of opportunities people always is looking for person with a good character,because costumer look the. In addition, all thinks the people said about you help you with your character, don't feel sad because you change your way to think. Obviously the take your time because you are not going to change in one morning but with a professional character more doors are going to open and more opportunities came so take other people influences.\\n\\nSome people argument the we should choose our own character traits, because some people just are going to tell you bad opinions in the way the you have to act. Moreover, some people believe the is no necessary to get a great character. In other hand we have to feel free in what we want to do we know what we need to change we don't have to do what others want because sometimes they just look for they benefits what is better for then and that dont have to be like that. In addition, some people don't care if you are okay, or how you feel. In addition others argument the is necessary listen to others influences because sometimes we don't find a way to resolve our character problems bur other know what to do and they try to find a way to make you live easy. For example, I know some people the dont know how to control they character when they are mad soy they contact person the know how to act in the situations. Also, some people take careers for find solution to person the have serious problems with they character I really dont know if is normal the people get mad went they want to eat, I have a friend with the problem in my point of view the is not normal because i never pass from the situation so I can't help her but people the have long time studying on the yes they can tell her what way to eat or i don't know but they have a solution for the problem in her character. In Addition all this problems can help you to have a good character a better attitude because is necessary for talk with other because we need to have a way a formed how to talk without breaking they feelings because as humans the we are we feel sad went other trade us with a mad face and sometimes we performed don't talk to then. So always remember the a good attitude change to many things.\\n\\nIn Conclusion, sometimes is necessary be influencing by other because they give you different ways how to be working in your character. In addition they received influences by other help you with the control in your character by changing a your way to act and covert you in a better person. Also help your character in a better way to think, in be focus on your ideas. In conclusion all this things are necessary in whatever way the you want to used then because in the proved of the live all things are necessary event if are smalls things they are necessary don't thing the people just influences your self in change your character because they just want to fight with not the is not like that is people is trying to give you a better influences about how you have to act because they always want better things to you. Always if you do bad on your character they are going to tell you and I thing the is more better if they tell you what you are doing wrong the others persons the you don't know came just for the just because you don't want to obey always think in you future. The is necessary a excellent character for a better work or food different's things the you want to realized.\",\n",
       " 'Summer projects should be student-designed because this is their time to relax. Students should not have to go through more school work during their time off. How would you feel if you get worked handed to you on your day off? Students should be able to design their projects because this is a students personal time, some students learn different from others, and students should be able to do a project that they enjoy.\\n\\nTo start off, this is a students personal time. Most students would not want to have work handed to them during the summer because they have been in school for ten months. Students should feel as if this is their time to relax and do whatever it is that they like. If they have to do a project, it should be something that they want to do instead of what the teacher wants them to do. For example, back in elementary school my teacher gave us a reading project to do over the break. It was a book that I hated and I thought, \"Who even likes to read, let alone over break.\" I was so made that we have to do this project, but if it had been a book that i actually wanted to read, I would have been more likely to do the project.\\n\\nSecondly, some students learn in different ways than others. Not every single person learns the same as the next. Everyone is either an auditory, a visual, or a hands-on learner. Many people could prefer something totally different from you, so a teacher just handing a student a project and telling them to do it, will not help them to learn. For instance, I am a visual and hands-on learner, but the person next to me could be an auditory learner.\\n\\nLastly, students should be able to do a project that they enjoy. If students are given a project that they do not want to do or are at least interested in, the chances of them doing it are low. They don\\'t even want to have work over the break, but if they are given something that they are interested in, they will most likely do it.\\n\\nSome will think agree with my claim, others will disagree. The ones that disagree will probably say that teachers should design the projects. They may say that the teacher knows what is best for their students and that if the students have some authority over their project, they will do or pick something that does nothing for their knowledge and education. They may also say that they need to learn that not everything can got their way in life and they have to deal with what is front of them. I say that we give students the opportunity to be students and live their life as teens as much as they possibly can before they jump right into the real world. I believe that students should design their projects, but the teachers should approve. Compromising is a key factor in this. If people want the students to not have so much control over a project for school, teachers should be more open minded\\xa0and be able to at least give their students a choice of enjoyable projects for the students to work on over break. Even then, students still have some sort of choice of what they find pleasurable to work on over their free time and still end up getting a grade for the work that they have completed.\\n\\nIn conclusion, students should be able to design their project over the break because it is their personal time, some students learn different from others, and students should be able to do a project that they enjoy. Students are maturing as the days go by. If we don\\'t give them some sort of authority as they grow up, they will not develop into adults that can handle the real world. Letting them have some sort of freedom or choice over what they want to do, will benefit them in the long run and not let them grow up so fast. Looking at this from a students point of view will give you an open mind about my position on this topic. Students should be able to feel a since of freedom when it comes tho their break and not feel stressed or pressured to do more school work during their time off.',\n",
       " \"Growing up I've always had a hard time being my true self in the world today. From the pressures of peers to the sometimes harsh judgements of society, it can be difficult to feel comfortable in your own skin. I remember my junior year of high school, when I was really struggling to stay true to my identity. I wanted so badly to follow the trends and fit in with the crowd, yet my inner voice kept reminding me that I didn't have to be like everyone else. It felt empowering to finally make that decision and embrace my true self, in spite of the pressure around me. \\n\\nAnother moment that stands out to me is when I was in college and chose to focus my studies on philosophy and history, rather than the more typical path of business studies. This didn't sit too well with my family, however I knew it was my passion and I could not ignore it. It took a lot of courage for me to go against the grain and make the decision to pursue a degree in something that mattered to me.\\n\\nLearning to be my true self was one of the greatest accomplishments of my life. Though difficult at times, it was so worth it in the end. With every step I take towards embracing my true self, I feel more empowered and in tune with my identity. It's a liberating process that I couldn't recommend enough to others who are struggling to break their own barriers as well.\",\n",
       " 'Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, \"Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.\" This statement highlights the importance of individuality and pursuing one\\'s own dreams, rather than following the crowd or conforming to societal expectations. In order to succeed in life, it is essential to master something beyond the ordinary and to not let the opinions of others hold you back.\\n\\nOne of the key ways to achieve success is by following your dreams and pursuing your passions. When you are passionate about something, you are more likely to put in the effort and dedication required to master it. This can lead to a sense of fulfillment and purpose, which can be motivating and inspiring. Additionally, when you are pursuing something that you are truly interested in, you are more likely to be innovative and creative, which can help you stand out from the competition.\\n\\nHowever, it is important to remember that not everyone will support your dreams and aspirations. There will be negative people who try to bring you down and discourage you from pursuing your passions. These people may be jealous or fearful of your success, or they may simply not understand your vision. It is important to recognize when someone is trying to bring you down and to ignore them. Instead, focus on your own goals and aspirations, and let your own passion and determination guide you.\\n\\nWhile it is important to follow your own dreams, it is also important to seek advice and guidance from others. While it is important to be independent and self-reliant, it is also important to recognize that others may have valuable insights and perspectives that can help you achieve your goals. Seeking advice from others can help you identify potential obstacles and challenges, and can provide you with strategies and tactics for overcoming them.\\n\\nFinally, it is important to remember the power of positive words and language. When you speak positively and confidently, you are more likely to inspire and motivate others. This can help you build a strong support system and can provide you with the encouragement and motivation you need to achieve your goals.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the key to success in life is to master something beyond the ordinary and to pursue your own dreams.

       " 'For most students, summer is the best time for students to relax and release the stress that they endured during the torturous school year. However, some students are required to complete summer projects to make sure the knowledge that they have attained from those nine or ten months of school doesn\\'t leak out of their brains. This is not a bad thing because it allows for teachers to know what they should focus on for the new year when these students come back. Summer projects should be designed by teachers because the summer projects will be graded by teachers, teachers already have the knowledge about the curriculum, and students will be too lazy to want to design a project for their summer.\\n\\nSummer projects should be designed by teachers because, in the end, teachers are going to be the ones grading it. Grading things, often, take a lot of time from teachers. However, the time it takes to grade could change by the subject that the teacher is grading.\\n\\nFor example, a math teacher could take two or three days to grade all of their students\\' math tests. On the other hand, English teachers could take a week to a month to grade essays for all of their students. Projects take a long to do because the purpose is to see what the student knows overall and allow them learn things they didn\\'t know before. Teachers are going to grade these projects at the beginning of the year, but they are also expected to begin teaching students new information of the course and grade other things assigned to put in the grade for first quarter. It would be stressful for the teacher if the students were able to design a project that would barely passed the minimum effort expected or if the students design a project that far and beyond. It would be a chaos for teachers to grade. Therefore, teachers should be able to design a project that they believe would allow them to efficiently grade at a faster pace.\\n\\nThe people that should design the summer assignments are the people that know the subject of the summer projects the best and those people are teachers. It easy to say that designing a project is easy. However, it\\'s difficult to find the resources and plan out a project that would effectively help new students learn the information they need for the new year. It will be difficult for new students to make a project on what they don\\'t know. Teachers, on the other hand, know about the subject and the important things that students should focus on. They know websites, videos, movies, documents, or other resources that are helpful to students. For example, I had an AP United States summer project that I had to do in the summer of 2019. The teacher give us YouTube links to watch from and made us practice how to write different types of essays. The project wasn\\'t boring. It taught people a lot of useful skills by allowing them to watch videos and reading sources. I learned a lot of things that I didn\\'t know before. This example shows that teachers already have the information to make a good summer project that allows new students to learn effectively.\\n\\nHonestly, students are too lazy to want to design a project. If a student is too lazy to do a summer project, why would they want to make a summer project that will be source of their suffering and anxiety for the summer? For example, I had an English book that I was suppose to read in the summer of 2018. I did not even read a page in that chosen book. It was the easiest summer project ever and I was too lazy to even do that. Students want to have fun during their summer. They don\\'t want to design a project for their summer. People could argue that designing a project is fun or if a student designed a summer project then they could make it be easy. However, the project will never be truly \"student-designed\\' because teachers and schools will have a requirement of what is suppose to be on the project that students will be designing. Also, summer projects are for new students. These new students know nothing to very little information about the new subject that they will be taking for the upcoming year. If teachers or the school expects students to do research on the subject to make their summer project. They might as well just make their own summer project because either way the student is gonna be force to learn something new. It will only be more work for the student to design a project for the summer that they will have little information about or they won\\'t even be able to do it because they won\\'t be in the class next year.\\n\\nIn conclusion, teachers should be the ones designing summer projects because they know the most about the subject, they\\'re going to grade these projects, and students are too lazy to design a project. People can argue that a student can still design a summer project and make it enjoyable, even with teachers\\' requirements. However, it would be so difficult for teachers and students because teachers will be forced to make requirements of what should be on the summer project and be forced to see if the summer project is effective. Students will be forced to make a summer project for new students and not for them because they\\'re going to move to a different grade or subject the next year. Unless new students are making it. However if new students make it, they won\\'t even know what are the important things that should be on the project or how to most effectively gather the information. It\\'ll be too difficult, therefore teachers should just design the projects themselves.',\n",

One, drunk drivers and two, kids using the cars.\\n\\nTechnology has been becoming more advanced over the years from phones all the way up to cars now. In paragraph four lines one through two says, \"Without the option of smarter roads, manufacturers turned to smarter cars.\"\\n\\nSmarter cars are not going to make the world safer because not everyone will be able to afford the new \"smart car\". These new \"smart cars\" will probably be hybrids running on electricity instead of gas.

Well, I personally think all students should be required to perform community service, because it can really help the less fortunate and homeless. And with our community working together to help one another we can rapidly make the world a better place.\\n\\nThere are many ways students can help their community. For example they can cook food and send it to a local soup kitchen, donate food or clothing to the poor, or even form a resistance group to help stop world hunger! I think its possible for students my age to change the world to make it a better place. Which by that we would also be following the ways of Jesus.

       " \"I think that we should totally switch to renewable energy sources! Fossil fuels are bad for the environment and they're going to run out eventually, so it's a good idea to start using renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. Plus, they're getting cheaper and more efficient all the time.\\n\\nFor one thing, fossil fuels release greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere, which contribute to climate change. Climate change is causing all sorts of problems, like sea levels rising, droughts, and extreme weather events. It's important that we reduce our carbon footprint and transition to cleaner energy sources to mitigate the worst effects of climate change.\\n\\nAnother reason is that renewable energy sources are becoming more cost-effective. The cost of solar and wind power has dropped significantly over the past decade, making them more competitive with fossil fuels. Plus, renewable energy sources are sustainable, meaning they'll never run out. We'll never have to worry about the sun or wind running out, unlike fossil fuels which are finite resources.\\n\\nAdditionally, renewable energy sources create jobs! Installing and maintaining solar panels and wind turbines requires skilled workers, which can boost local economies. In fact, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the renewable energy industry already employs over 500,000 people in the United States alone.\\n\\nFinally, using renewable energy sources can increase energy independence. Countries that rely heavily on fossil fuels are often subject to price fluctuations and geopolitical tensions. By using renewable energy sources, countries can reduce their dependence on imported fossil fuels and improve their energy security.\\n\\nOf course, there are some challenges to overcome when transitioning to renewable energy. For example, the intermittency of renewable energy sources can make it difficult to ensure a consistent supply of electricity. However, with advances in technology and energy storage solutions, this problem is becoming less of an issue.\\n\\nIn conclusion, transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources is a smart move for the planet, the economy, and our future. It's a win-win situation!\",\n",
       " 'Being yourself is an important aspect of life that is often overlooked. It is easy to get caught up in the desire to fit in and be accepted by others, but this can lead to a loss of individuality and authenticity. In this essay, I will discuss the importance of being yourself and provide an example from personal experience.\\n\\nOne of the reasons why it is important to be yourself is that it allows you to express your true thoughts and feelings. When you try to act like someone you are not, you are hiding your true self and suppressing your individuality. This can lead to feelings of frustration and unhappiness, as you are not able to fully express yourself.\\n\\nFor example, when I was in middle school, I struggled with fitting in and making friends. I often felt like I had to act a certain way in order to be accepted by my peers. However, I soon realized that this was not sustainable and that I was not able to be myself. I began to embrace my true self and started to make friends based on my interests and passions, rather than trying to fit in with the popular crowd. This allowed me to express myself fully and feel more authentic in my interactions with others.\\n\\nAnother reason why it is important to be yourself is that it allows you to build meaningful relationships. When you are trying to act like someone you are not, you are not able to form genuine connections with others. This is because you are not able to fully express yourself and build trust with others.\\n\\nFor example, when I was in high school, I had a friend who always tried to act like someone else in order to fit in. However, this made it difficult for us to have meaningful conversations and build a strong friendship. We were not able to fully express ourselves and understand each other, which led to a lack of depth in our relationship. Eventually, we drifted apart because we were not able to build a strong foundation based on authenticity.\\n\\nIn conclusion, being yourself is an important aspect of life that allows you to express your true thoughts and feelings, build meaningful relationships, and feel more authentic in your interactions with others. It is easy to get caught up in the desire to fit in and be accepted by others, but this can lead to a loss of individuality and authenticity. By embracing your true self, you can build strong, meaningful relationships and feel more authentic in your interactions with others.',\n",

By learning about their struggles, achievements, and decision-making processes, I can gain valuable insights into how they were able to reach their goals and how I can apply those lessons to my own life.\\n\\nFor example, I find myself drawn to entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, who were able to turn their passions into successful businesses despite facing numerous obstacles along the way. Their stories show me that with hard work, determination, and a willingness to take risks, I can pursue my own dreams and make them a reality.\\n\\nAt the same time, I also believe that it's important to create my own ideas based on my own life experiences and instincts. While researching successful people can provide valuable guidance, I know that my own unique perspective and experiences are what will ultimately shape my future. By trusting my instincts and following my passions, I can create a path that is truly my own.\\n\\nOf course, making decisions is never easy, and there are always potential drawbacks to consider. Before making a decision, I like to weigh the benefits and drawbacks carefully, thinking through all the possible outcomes and how they might affect my life. This helps me make informed choices that align with my goals and values.\\n\\nFinally, I believe that collecting as much life experience as possible is crucial for making informed decisions in the future. By trying new things, meeting new people, and exploring new places, I can broaden my horizons and gain a deeper understanding of the world around me. This will help me make better decisions and live a more fulfilling life.\\n\\nOverall, I believe that staying confident in myself and my decisions is essential for achieving success in life.

The dreaded math packet holds the number one spot, but what if the students could choose how their homework is designed.\\xa0There needs to be a way to inspire students to keep up with studies and find pleasure in the chosen topic. If students design their own projects they may find more interest in completing the assignment, a passion for their chosen subject, and a project to boost their grade in class.\\n\\nTeachers always struggle to find a project that students will be interested in completing. Students want to enjoy the summer and not have to worry about taking time out of their day to study. When they design the project themselves they can incorporate the work into their daily lives and activities to make it fun. One student may choose to solve math problems around the mall while others, choose to shoot a soccer ball every time\\xa0they mention a scientific kingdom. This will be an easy way to learn while completing many daily things and students will feel proud of their accomplishments.\\n\\nWhen a teacher gives out a packet, students are not always pleased or excited about it. They normally consist of long word problems and that can often bore students, but lets say each word problem is a coordinate, one that leads to a park\\xa0in the neighborhood or a friends house. After the student takes this long adventure they designed, they may find themselves enjoying the trip and the exploration they got to do. They went outside and got some fresh air while completing a summer project. In the future maybe the student wants to fly plains and travel. Now they can solve the math to accomplish those travel plans.\\n\\nAt the end of the year students stress about grades and the most common complaint is; how can I get my grade up for the end of the year. The teachers also have to search for simple projects to close the learning gap after SOL's. An easy way to accomplish this would be to assign a project, one that the students will keep with them into the summer. The students will be required to make their own, exciting, project by themselves. Instead of some boring old packet with 120 questions, this packet is tailored to their creative ideas. The packet they made may send them on an adventure through the mall or even a park. They will turn it in and the teacher will hand it back, after grading, for them to fill out over the summer.\\n\\nDesigning their own summer projects left the students inspired to reach for their goals and go into the next year with a more developed brain. All of this was possible because their ideas could become a solid base for amazing adventures. Students should get to design a project they feel best suits them, it may help them find themselves and their future in school.\",\n",

Many successful people have experienced failure at some point in their lives, but they didn\\'t let it hold them back. They learned from their mistakes and kept pushing forward.\\n\\nTake scientists, for example. Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, is famous for saying, \"I have not failed. I\\'ve just found 10,000 ways that won\\'t work.\" He failed many times before finally succeeding, but he didn\\'t let that discourage him. He kept trying until he found the right solution.\\n\\nStudents can also benefit from failure. When I was in 7th grade, I took a math test and got a C. I was devastated, but my teacher told me that it was okay and that I just needed to work harder. So, I studied harder for the next test and ended up getting an A. If I had given up after that first test, I never would have reached my goal.\\n\\nEntrepreneurs also know the power of failure. Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, was fired from the company he founded. But he didn\\'t let that setback stop him. He went on to create some of the most innovative products in the world, including the iPhone and the iPad.\\n\\nSocial media has also played a role in achieving success. Many people use social media platforms like Instagram and YouTube to showcase their talents and build a following. Some people may initially fail to gain popularity, but they keep trying and eventually find success. For example, the popular YouTube channel, \"The Try Guys,\" started out with just a few followers, but they kept creating content and now have millions of subscribers.\\n\\nHowever, there are also examples of people who achieved success suddenly and without much failure. For instance, J.K. Rowling wrote the first Harry Potter book in just a few months and it quickly became a bestseller.

However, when working in a group, each person can take on a specific task, allowing for a more efficient workflow.\\n\\nSecondly, humor and laughter can provide motivation when working in groups. When people are laughing and having fun, they are more likely to feel relaxed and engaged in the task at hand. This can lead to increased productivity and a more positive work environment.\\n\\nThirdly, team-work and collaboration can improve the outcome of group work. When people work together, they can combine their strengths and skills to achieve a common goal. This can lead to more creative and innovative solutions to problems, as well as a better understanding of the task at hand.\\n\\nFourthly, working with people that you don’t usually interact with in school can provide new perspectives and ideas. When people come from different backgrounds and have different experiences, they can bring unique insights and approaches to the table. This can lead to more well-rounded and thoughtful solutions to problems.\\n\\nFinally, it is important to understand a topic fully before working on a group project.

While some may argue that people have control over their character traits, others believe that their character is formed by influences beyond their control. In my opinion, people's character traits are a combination of both their own choices and external factors.\\n\\nOn one hand, people have the ability to make choices that shape their character. For example, a person may choose to be kind and empathetic because they value these traits and want to be a positive influence on others. Similarly, a person may choose to be hardworking and responsible because they see these traits as important for achieving their goals. By making these choices, people can develop positive character traits that they value and want to embody.\\n\\nOn the other hand, people's character traits can also be influenced by external factors beyond their control. For example, a person may be born with certain genetic predispositions that make them more likely to be introverted or extroverted. Additionally, a person's upbringing and environment can also play a significant role in shaping their character traits. For example, a person who grew up in a nurturing and supportive environment may be more likely to be empathetic and compassionate, while a person who grew up in a harsh and critical environment may be more likely to be guarded and reserved.\\n\\nIn conclusion, people's character traits are a combination of both their own choices and external factors.

       " \"The concept of never giving up is one that is often talked about, but not always practiced. It is an idea that has been around for centuries and has been exemplified by many great individuals throughout history. One such individual is Thomas Jefferson, who played a crucial role in the founding of the United States of America. Jefferson's determination and persistence in the face of adversity is an inspiration to many and serves as a reminder of the importance of never giving up on our dreams.\\n\\nThomas Jefferson was a man of great vision and ambition. He was a founding father, a writer, an inventor, and a statesman. He was also a man who faced many challenges and setbacks in his life. However, despite these challenges, Jefferson never gave up on his dreams and continued to work towards them.\\n\\nOne of the most notable examples of Jefferson's determination can be seen in his work on the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson was tasked with writing the document that would declare the 13 colonies independent from Great Britain. However, the task was not an easy one. Jefferson faced many challenges and setbacks as he worked on the document. He was constantly criticized and questioned by his peers and had to make numerous revisions to the document.\\n\\nDespite these challenges, Jefferson never gave up on his work. He continued to work tirelessly, refusing to let the criticism and setbacks deter him from achieving his goal. Eventually, the Declaration of Independence was approved and signed by the Continental Congress, marking a major milestone in the history of the United States.\\n\\nJefferson's example is relevant to modern day life because it shows us that no matter how difficult the task may seem, we must never give up on our dreams. We must be persistent and determined in the face of adversity, and continue to work towards our goals. The world is full of challenges and setbacks, but with determination and persistence, we can overcome them and achieve our dreams.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the importance of never giving up cannot be overstated. Thomas Jefferson's example serves as a reminder of the power of determination and persistence in achieving our goals. We must take inspiration from his life and work towards our dreams with unwavering determination, no matter what obstacles we may face.\",\n",
       " 'Sure, here\\'s my attempt at writing an essay on the pros and cons of businesses and schools instituting a 4-day, 10 hour work/school week, written from the perspective of an average 8th grade student:\\n\\nPros of a 4-day, 10 hour work week:\\n\\nI think that businesses and schools should consider implementing a 4-day, 10 hour work/school week because it would be really cool for people to have more time off to do things they enjoy. Like, imagine having an extra day to hang out with friends, go to the beach, or play video games. It would be so much fun! Plus, it would give people more time to relax and recharge, which would make them way more productive when they are at work or school.\\n\\nAnother pro is that it would help the environment. With fewer days in the workweek, there would be less traffic and pollution from people commuting to work. And, since schools would also be closed one day, there would be less energy used for heating and cooling buildings. It\\'s like, a win-win for the planet!\\n\\nCons of a 4-day, 10 hour work week:\\n\\nBut, there are also some cons to consider. One of them is that businesses might not make as much money if they are only open four days a week. Like, if a store is only open four days, they might not sell as many things. And, if schools are only open four days, they might not be able to cover as much material. That could be really bad for students who need extra help or who are trying to get into a good college.\\n\\nAnother con is that it could be really hard for people to adjust to having an extra day off. Like, imagine if you were used to working five days a week and then suddenly you only had to work four. It would be like, \"What do I do with myself?\" And, it might be hard for people to balance their work and personal life if they have an extra day off.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while a 4-day, 10 hour work/school week might have some cool benefits, like more time off and less impact on the environment, there are also some pretty big cons to consider. So, I think businesses',\n",

Details from the article of the use of Facial Action Coding System to read the emothional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable becaues it helps us understand emotions, it helps us see true emotions, and it helps us connect with emotions.\\n\\nMy frist support is that it helps us understand. According to the article it can detake mixed emotions. For example the new emotion-recognition software trackes these facial movements- in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. It can also indcated where it is a gerneral smile or a fake smile.\\n\\nMy second support is we can see true emotions. The article staes that in a false smile the mouth is streacted sideways using the zygomatic major. In a real smile, the zygomatic major lift the corners of your mouth. So it proves that this tecnonlgy can indicate the differnce between a genuine smile and a forced one.\\n\\nMy last support is that we can connect with emotions. The facial Feedback Theory of Emotion says that moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. An example is a drama couch has his students smile and frown to produce those emotions on stage and really feel them.\\n\\nDetails for the article of the use of this techonolgy to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable becaues it helps us understand emotions, it helps us see true emotions, and it helps us connect with them.

On one hand, proponents cite the potential for students to enter college and the workforce earlier, allowing them to gain valuable experience sooner and reap the related benefits. Parents and teachers might view this as a way to ensure those students who wish to move onto higher education or a career have the ability to do so quickly. \\n\\nOn the other hand, such a change may create an environment which shortcuts student development, reducing the amount of important life skills and lessons that a traditional four year high school experience provides. Students may not be ready to handle the greater responsibility, and without an adequate high school experience, may find themselves unprepared to adjust and succeed. \\n\\nIn the long run, it is difficult to say whether reducing high school to three years is the right call. On the one hand, it may be beneficial to students who wish to move onto college or a job, but at the same time, it may mean they don’t have the skills necessary to succeed in those ventures.

       " ' Influencing others is a crucial aspect of our lives, and there are different ways to achieve this goal. While setting a good example is one way to influence others, there are other methods that can be equally effective. In my opinion, setting a good example can be a powerful way to influence others because it shows them that it is possible to do good things and make a positive impact on the world.\\n\\nWhen people see you doing something good, they may be inspired to do the same. They might think, \"If he can do it, then I can do it too.\" This can lead to a chain reaction of positive behavior, as more and more people start to do good deeds. By setting an example, you can help to create a culture of kindness and generosity in your community.\\n\\nFurthermore, setting a good example can be especially important for younger people. Kids often look up to their older siblings and role models, and if you set a positive example for them, they may be more likely to follow in your footsteps. This can be especially beneficial for younger kids, who may not yet have a clear understanding of what is right and wrong. By showing them that doing good things is possible and rewarding, you can help to shape their values and behavior for the better.\\n\\nIn addition to influencing others, setting a good example can also help to promote safety. For example, if there is a dangerous situation, such as a robbery or a shooting, adults may be more likely to protect the younger kids if they see that you are setting a positive example. Similarly, if you are in school and show up on time and are ready to do your work, teachers may be more likely to use you as an example for others to follow.\\n\\nOverall, while setting a good example is just one way to influence others, it can be a powerful tool for promoting positive behavior and shaping the values of the next generation. By showing people that it is possible to do good things and make a difference in the world, you can help to create a brighter future for all of us.',\n",

I found out that many schools in our area offer internship programs for students interested in a particular field. For example, my school has a partnership with a local hospital where students can intern in different departments like nursing, medical technology, or even administration. This would be a great way for me to get hands-on experience in the medical field and see if it's really something I want to pursue as a career. Plus, it looks great on college applications!\\n\\nAnother cool thing I found out is that some companies offer shadowing opportunities for high school students. This means I can spend a day at a company and follow around an employee to see what their job is like.

This would give me a better idea of what the job entails and if it's something I'd enjoy.\\n\\nNow, let's talk about the pros and cons of each option. Internships are great because they give you real-world experience and can help you figure out if you like a particular field. But, they can also be time-consuming and might not always be paid. Shadowing, on the other hand, is a great way to learn more about a specific job without committing to an internship.

One decision can change your life and if it's really important that you are right. This is why you should go to multiple people for advice, so you don't make the wrong choice. If you make a bad choice it hurts you not them, so you need to make sure you make the right decision. I think you should get multiple peoples advice before acting on something because people have different opining's, some people just give bad advice, and some people you just can't trust.\\n\\nThe first reason you should ask multiple people for advice is because people have different opining's. Sometimes there isn't a clear right or wrong choice and it just all comes down to what different people believe. If you only go to one person they will only share their opining which is only half the story. This is why it's important to get multiple peoples advice because you need both sides of the story to make a good decision for yourself.\\n\\nMy second reason you should go to multiple people for advice is that some people give bad advice. Some of the people you will talk to will not know what there talking about. They will give you bad advice that when you act on will hurt you one way or another. That's why it's important to go to multiple people because if the first person you talk to gives you bad advice the second person will clear things up. I know this from experience\\xa0because I once went to my brother for advice, but when I told my mom what his advice was she told me how wrong it was and what the right choice was.\\n\\nMy last reason you should go to multiple people for advice is because theres some people you just can't trust. As much as you want to deny it they're people in this world that wish you harm and want you to fail either to help them or to make them feel good. One way they try to do this is by giving you bad advice and if you don't go to multiple people you will take there bad advice.\\xa0Remember one bad choice can change your life, so taking that person advice can even send you to jail.\\n\\nYou should ask for multiple peoples opining\\xa0because people think differently, some people don't give good advice, and there are some people that want you to fail.

       " '\"Does Electoral College Work?\"\\n\\nToday I am going to write about how electoral colleges work. The Electrical College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of a President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Do you want to learn more? Then just keep on reading and I will tell you more.\\n\\nThe Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Our state\\'s entitled allotmeant of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for our Senators.\\n\\nEach candidate running for President in our state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidiate\\'s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. Most states have a \"Winner-take-all\\n\\n\" system that awards al electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of \"proportional representation.\"\\n\\nWhat have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They\\'re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the President, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the President. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party\\'s central commitee, sometimes the Presidential candidates themselves. The single best argument against the electoral college is what they might call the disaster factor. Perhaps most worrying is the prospct of a tie in the electoral vote. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters.\\n\\nThe Electoral College is widely regarded as an anarchronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a President and ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense. It is the electors who elect the the President, nort the people. When you vote for a Presidential candidate you\\'re actually voting for a slate of electors. Yet this has happened very rarely. It happend in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

       " ' The Opportunity to Graduate Early: Benefits and Advantages\\n\\nHigh school students have the option to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. These programs include summer or after-school activities, and students cannot take elective classes. However, they must take the necessary courses to graduate. This essay will explore the benefits and advantages of graduating early, including job opportunities, college entrance, and personal growth.\\n\\nOne of the biggest advantages of graduating early is the increased job opportunities that become available. Employers often prefer young, energetic, and inexperienced workers, as they bring fresh perspectives and are willing to learn. By finishing high school early, students can begin working and gaining experience in their chosen field, making them more attractive to potential employers. Additionally, students who graduate early may be able to take on more responsibilities and leadership roles in their work, which can lead to career advancement.\\n\\nAnother advantage of graduating early is the ability to enter college one year earlier. This can be especially beneficial for students who are planning to pursue a four-year degree. By starting college early, students can complete their general education requirements and take classes in their major before their peers, giving them a head start on their education. This can also save students time and money in the long run, as they will be able to graduate from college sooner.\\n\\nIn addition to job and college opportunities, graduating early can also provide personal growth and development. By completing their high school education early, students can take advantage of the summer or after-school activities offered by their school. These activities can range from internships to community service projects, and can provide valuable experiences that will help students develop new skills and interests. Additionally, graduating early can give students a sense of accomplishment and pride, as they have achieved a significant milestone in their lives.\\n\\nWhile some may argue that students should have fun in summer instead of going to school or that they should not stay after school to focus on other activities, the benefits of graduating early far outweigh any potential negatives. By taking advantage of these programs, students can improve their education, increase their job opportunities, and have a better future. Therefore, it is important for students who want to improve themselves to take advantage of these programs and graduate early.',\n",
       " 'An act of kindness is a voluntary act of generosity. It is a selfless act that can be done with no expectation of recognition or reward. It can range from a simple “thank you” to a hug or to an extreme act such as donating money, volunteering time or helping a complete stranger. The primary outcome of an act of kindness is the feeling of being appreciated and valued. It is known to have a lasting impact on people and improve the overall safety and happiness of those around them. \\n\\nFor example, when a homeless person on the street receives a hot meal or a trinket from a passerby, the feeling of kindness and the appreciation felt can spread, even to those not necessarily involved. It can have a ripple effect within the community, inspiring others to do something kind for someone in need. It can also help build a sense of community, bringing people together that would have otherwise been strangers.\\n\\nOf course, even the smallest act of kindness can be incredibly powerful. Helping a friend in need, lending a fresher friend some notes, or even merely smiling can make a big difference to someone. The mere gesture of kindness can significantly boost a person’s self-esteem and even start a chain reaction of kindness.',\n",

Some situations may include popping up media.\\n\\nOne reason why I think this is a great idea is because of it's function where it recognizes what you're feeling, and make modifications based around it, so you'll feel better. In the text, it mentions of how the software can detect whether someone is confused or bored, and can make some modifications to better suit the person. This shows that when it does that, it can help students better understand the topic. In the text, it mentions how when the software detects your emotion, it sends over an ad based on how you feel. This shows that if someone is feeling sad, they can send them an article about how to get better or how to overcome a loss, which is really useful. This is great for using media to assist you, but of course, it has a human-caused benefit.\\n\\nThe software can help you make random faces, and when done, it can help you with your emotions. In the text, it states that making fake smiley faces actually causes you to feel slightly happy. This shows that when you're making a fake smiley face when down, there's a chemical in your body that actually can help you get better. In the text, it states that Stanislavsky has his students make happy faces and frowning faces, due to the previous fact to help them better act. This shows that the software can help you detect whether or not you're actually acting a feeling well or not. Now, there is a benefit for those who don't have a software.\\n\\nThe software can detect facial muscles, and that helps it point out what a person is feeling. In the text, it states that the software succesfully recognized Mona Lisa's facial muscles, and it showed her to be 83% happy. This shows that the software can go through many paintings and easily detect how they're feeling. In the text, it states that with it's muscle-detecting technology, it can detect whether or now a politician or celebrity is being truthful or not. This shows that the software can detect whether or not a celebrity is lying, and that can helpful, especially in an allegation.\\n\\nOverall, I believe that this technology is good to have around. It can detect how you feel, and attempt to assist you. It can cause you to make fake happy faces and actually feel happy. Finally, it can help out with detecting a truthful person or not. With that said, I believe that this will go great with classrooms in the country. \",\n",
       " 'As an eighth-grade student, I believe that the American government has a responsibility to provide services to its citizens in order to reduce poverty and inequality. In this essay, I will discuss some potential solutions to accomplish these goals and analyze their potential impact on the American population.\\n\\nOne way that the government can reduce poverty is by increasing funding for social programs. Social programs such as food stamps, Medicaid, and housing assistance can provide essential resources to low-income families, helping them to meet their basic needs. Additionally, the government can also increase funding for education, which can provide opportunities for individuals to improve their economic situation and reduce poverty in the long term.\\n\\nAnother solution that the government can implement is to increase the minimum wage. By raising the minimum wage, low-wage workers will be able to earn more money, which can help to reduce poverty. However, it is important to note that increasing the minimum wage can also have negative consequences, such as increased costs for businesses and potentially higher prices for consumers.\\n\\nThe government can also implement policies to reduce income inequality. For example, progressive taxation, where higher-income individuals pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes, can help to redistribute wealth and reduce income inequality. Additionally, the government can also implement policies to promote equal pay for equal work, such as requiring businesses to pay their employees the same wage for the same job regardless of gender or race.\\n\\nIt is important to note that while these solutions may have the potential to reduce poverty and inequality, they are not a silver bullet. Poverty and inequality are complex issues that require a multi-faceted approach. Additionally, it is important for the government to consider the potential impact of these solutions on the American population, and to ensure that they are implemented in a way that is fair and equitable for all.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the American government has a responsibility to provide services to its citizens in order to reduce poverty and inequality. While there are many potential solutions to accomplish these goals, it is important to carefully consider the potential impact of these solutions on the American population. By working together, we can create a more just and equitable society for all.',\n",

While some students see it as an opportunity to get ahead, others view it as a burden that can hinder their future success. In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of graduating early from high school and analyze the responsibilities and benefits of doing so.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of graduating early from high school is that it allows students to pursue their dreams and aspirations earlier. For instance, if a student wants to attend a prestigious college or university, they can apply earlier and increase their chances of being accepted. Additionally, early graduates can start their careers sooner, which can lead to more job opportunities and higher salaries.\\n\\nHowever, graduating early from high school also comes with its fair share of responsibilities. For example, early graduates may feel pressured to attend college immediately, even if they are not ready. This can lead to financial strain and a lack of maturity, which can negatively impact their academic and personal growth.\\n\\nAnother disadvantage of graduating early from high school is that it can limit the amount of time students have to explore their interests and passions. High school is a time for students to discover what they love and pursue their hobbies and extracurricular activities. Early graduates may miss out on these experiences, which can lead to feelings of regret and a lack of fulfillment.\\n\\nOn the other hand, graduating early from high school can also provide students with a sense of accomplishment and pride. Early graduates have achieved a significant milestone in their lives and can use this accomplishment to boost their confidence and motivation. Additionally, early graduates may have a better understanding of the real world and the responsibilities that come with it, which can prepare them for the future.\\n\\nIn conclusion, graduating early from high school has both advantages and disadvantages. While it can provide students with opportunities to pursue their dreams and aspirations earlier, it also comes with responsibilities that can hinder their future success. Ultimately, the decision to graduate early from high school should be made carefully, taking into consideration the student's individual circumstances and goals.\",\n",
       " 'Influence on others is a powerful tool that can shape the way people think, act and behave. It can be positive or negative, depending on the type of influence and the impact it has on individuals and society. In this essay, I will compare and contrast the positive and negative aspects of influence on others, identify examples of both, and explain the impact of influence on people.\\n\\nOn the positive side, influence can be a driving force for change and progress. For example, a leader who inspires their followers to work towards a common goal can have a tremendous impact on society. The civil rights movement in the United States is an excellent example of how positive influence can bring about meaningful change. Leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X used their influence to rally people to fight for equality and justice. Their messages of hope and determination inspired millions of people to take action and make a difference.\\n\\nAnother positive aspect of influence is the ability to foster creativity and innovation. When people are exposed to new ideas and perspectives, they are more likely to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions to problems. For example, the tech industry is full of individuals who have used their influence to create new and exciting products and services.\\n\\nOn the negative side, influence can also be a force for harm and destruction. For example, a charismatic leader who uses their influence to manipulate and control others can have a devastating impact on individuals and society. The rise of dictatorships and authoritarian regimes throughout history is a prime example of how negative influence can lead to suffering and oppression.\\n\\nIn addition, negative influence can also lead to the spread of harmful ideas and beliefs. For example, the influence of social media on young people has been shown to have a negative impact on their mental health and well-being. Exposure to violent and hateful content can also lead to the spread of intolerance and bigotry.\\n\\nIn conclusion, influence on others can be a powerful tool for positive or negative change. While positive influence can bring about meaningful change and foster creativity and innovation, negative influence can lead to harm and destruction. It is important for individuals to be aware of the impact of their influence on others and to use it responsibly. By doing so, we can create a world that is more just, equitable, and peaceful.',\n",
       " \"Dear Principal,\\n\\nI have heard that you are thinking of changing the grade average policy from C average to B to participate in school activities and sports.\\n\\nI absolutely love this idea but it could hurt our sport teams and our activities. It could hurt them because at least half of them have a C average which means they wouldn't be able to play and it could effect our school team. Our school events for sports are a big thing I mean a lot of people like to come and watch but if we were not that good because some of our kids were kicked off that would be sort of lame. For example, if our best player and also our biggest player did not have the grades to play he would be kicked off and we would not be that good.\\n\\nI would like if it stayed as a C average to be on the sports teams because out teams would stay the same and be good. If you did bad on one test and it dropped your grade to a C that means you could not play and that's not fair. I don't think that's fair because everyone does bad on at least one quiz or test. I would be really bummed if I couldn't play a game or two because i did bad on one single test.\\n\\nIf they did change the policy I don't think it would be helpful because our sports would start to go down.\\n\\nI think that everyone expects to much out of us kids, were just kids.

       " \"I believe that video games do not contribute to violent behavior. Video games are a form of entertainment and can actually have positive effects on players.\\n\\nFirstly, many studies have shown that there is no direct correlation between playing violent video games and engaging in real-life violent behavior. In fact, some studies suggest that playing video games can actually reduce aggression by providing an outlet for frustration and stress.\\n\\nFurthermore, video games can improve cognitive skills such as problem-solving, decision-making, and hand-eye coordination. They can also promote social interaction and teamwork when played in multiplayer modes.\\n\\nAdditionally, many popular video games today are not violent at all. Games like Minecraft, Animal Crossing, and Stardew Valley are all non-violent and focus on creativity, exploration, and building communities.\\n\\nFinally, it is important to remember that parents have a responsibility to monitor their children's video game usage and ensure they are playing age-appropriate games. Blaming video games for violent behavior is simply a way to shift responsibility away from parents and individuals themselves.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while some may argue that video games contribute to violent behavior, the evidence suggests otherwise. Video games can have positive effects on players and should not be demonized without proper evidence.\",\n",

Like, think about it, when we\\'re at home, we can take breaks whenever we want! And we can work on the computer, which is way easier than writing by hand. Plus, we get to stay with our fam, which is like, super comfy. And let\\'s be real, school can be kinda stressful, so having that extra time at home can help us relax.\\n\\nSo, I did some research and found out that doing school work at home can actually be really beneficial. Like, did you know that taking breaks can help us learn better? It\\'s true! Our brains need time to rest and process what we\\'re learning, so taking short breaks can actually make us more productive in the long run. And working on the computer can be way faster and more efficient than writing by hand. Plus, we can access all the resources we need online, like videos and articles, which can really help us understand the material better.\\n\\nAnd let\\'s not forget about the comfort level! Being at home can be way more comfortable than sitting in a classroom all day. We can wear our own clothes, eat our own food, and just be in our own environment. It\\'s like, way more relaxed and chill. And if we need help, we can just ask our parents or siblings, which can be way easier than asking a teacher.\\n\\nSo, I think doing school work at home can be really beneficial for students. It\\'s like, a win-win situation! We get to take breaks, work on the computer, stay with our fam, and be in a more comfortable environment. And who knows, maybe one day schools will have a \"work from home\" day and we can just chill in our PJs all day! 😂 (Just kidding, I think... 😅)',\n",
       " 'As an eighth-grade student, I believe that schools should have some control over the involvement of extracurricular activities. While extracurricular activities are important for personal development and socialization, they can also take away from academic performance and cause distractions in the classroom.\\n\\nOn the one hand, extracurricular activities provide students with opportunities to explore their interests and develop new skills. Participation in sports, clubs, and other organizations can help students build self-confidence, teamwork, and leadership skills. Additionally, extracurricular activities can provide a sense of community and belonging, which can be especially important for students who may be struggling academically or socially.\\n\\nHowever, extracurricular activities can also take away from academic performance. Students who participate in too many extracurricular activities may struggle to balance their commitments and maintain their grades. Additionally, extracurricular activities can be a source of distractions in the classroom, as students may be thinking about their upcoming practices or meetings instead of focusing on their studies.\\n\\nFurthermore, schools may have different priorities and goals for their students, and extracurricular activities may not align with those priorities. For example, a school may prioritize academic achievement over extracurricular involvement, which could lead to a lack of support for certain clubs or organizations.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while extracurricular activities are important for personal development and socialization, schools should have some control over their involvement. This control can help ensure that students are able to balance their commitments and maintain their academic performance, while also providing opportunities for personal growth and community building.',\n",
       " \"I disagree with the decision made by our principal that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While I understand the importance of being involved in school activities, mandating participation can have negative consequences for some students.\\n\\nFirstly, not all students have the same interests or abilities. Some students may not enjoy participating in sports or may not have the necessary skills to join a team. Similarly, some students may not have an interest in serving on the student council or working on the yearbook. By forcing students to participate in an activity they do not enjoy, they may feel unmotivated and unengaged.\\n\\nSecondly, some students may have family or work commitments that make it difficult for them to participate in extracurricular activities. For example, a student may have to work after school to support their family or may have family obligations that prevent them from joining a sports team. By requiring participation, these students may feel stressed and overwhelmed, leading to poor performance in their academic work.\\n\\nLastly, mandating participation can take away from the valuable learning experiences that extracurricular activities can provide. When students are forced to participate in an activity, they may not take it seriously or may not put in the same level of effort as they would if they had chosen to participate voluntarily. This can lead to a lack of personal growth and development, which is an important aspect of extracurricular activities.\\n\\nInstead of mandating participation, I suggest that the school should provide a variety of extracurricular activities and encourage students to participate voluntarily. This approach will allow students to choose activities that they are interested in and that align with their strengths and interests. It will also give students the opportunity to develop new skills, make new friends, and learn valuable life lessons.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while I understand the good intentions behind our principal's decision, I believe that mandating participation in extracurricular activities is not the best approach. Instead, we should focus on providing a range of activities and encouraging students to participate voluntarily, allowing them to have a positive and meaningful experience.\",\n",
       " 'Using a phone during driving can be very distracting as well as dangerous. Driving already requires concentration so being preoccupied could endanger not only the driver but others as well. Phones also have uses that support multitasking. Despite this drivers still might get preoccupied and lose concentration. I think drivers should only be able to execute something simple like talking on the phone while driving.\\n\\nDriving may look or sound fun but in truth it is very dangerous. Many people lost their lives behind the wheel either because there lack of concentration or a reckless driver. Sur vehicles have air bags but air bags don\\'t guarantee safety.

Things like texting should not be tolerated because it puts drivers and there passengers at risk. People behind wheels should realize that driving is dangerous.      ',\n",

       " \"People that have their faces in front of a screen with there back slouching with the help of technology. Technology is advancing year by year and month by month. When teens or adults get there hands on the new technology they will spend weeks or even months in their rooms, trying to figure out what the device can and cannot do. The limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a negative effect on peoples lives, because it can lead to bad communication skills, health problems and being inactive.\\n\\nHowever, not everyone agrees with this statement. Some people claim that technology has a positive effect on peoples lives. Neverless, this position overlooks an important point, mainly that technology cannot change how much human contact you have or do not have. For example, my friend she cannot drive, but she can have items get delivered to her; books, food, and clothes. Furthermore, when the delivery person came she did not know the proper way to greet him. Do to technology, people can have bad communication skills and they don't know how to communicate with people when they are in contact with someone.\\n\\nMoreover, by being isolated, technology can lead to bad communication skills. When someone gets the newest device or game, they want to know how it works. By learning what the device or video game can and cannot do, they usually spend a month learning how the device works or how to unlock the next level in the game. For instance, my brother got a new video game, he has isolated himself in his room, so he can beat the level and go on to the next. When he was finish with the level, he had a hard time communicating properly. Before he played his video game, his grammar was good; now it wasn't. For example he would use the wrong past and present tense. Thus, by staring at the screen for so long, he has got very inactive.\\n\\nAdditionally, sitting on the couch or in a chair with a screen in front of you, every day for a whole month can make a person inactive. People that are inactive can become very lazy, and they intend on making a lot of mistakes when they are talking. They can also gain weight or have health problems. To illustrate, sitting in front of a screen while eating junk food can cause you to gain weight and can lead to health issues. During spring break, my friend had nothing to do, he was on his laptop everyday eating junk food.\\n\\nNow he has to be careful on what he can and cannot eat, because he will get heart burn.\\n\\nIf he does not stop eating unhealthy foods in front of a screen he will gain more weight and have more health issues.\\n\\nHe does not know how to ask for help; he needs someone to push him to go outside and enjoy the weather, instead of being in front of a screen all day long.\\n\\nBased on this argument, one must conclude that the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a negative effect on peoples lives. Technology can effect us in many different ways; bad communication skills, health problems and being inactive. In conclusion, technology can change human contact in a negative way.\",\n",

       " ' I agree with the statement of Ralph Waldo Emerson that individuality is important. Being yourself is crucial to achieving success and fulfillment in life. When you embrace your true self, you may face opposition from others, but ultimately, it is worth it to be true to who you are.\\n\\nOne example of the benefits of individuality is that when you are yourself, you feel comfortable and confident. People may not always appreciate your authenticity, but it is important to stay true to yourself. You may also discover new strengths and talents that you never knew you had when you challenge yourself to be who you truly are.\\n\\nHowever, I understand that the world can be harsh and unforgiving. There will be times when you face adversity and temptation to conform to the expectations of others. But it is important to remember that you have the power to make your own choices and shape your own path in life.\\n\\nFor example, in my own life, I have faced challenges such as the loss of a loved one and the pressure to conform to societal expectations. But I have learned that the only way to truly succeed and be happy is to be true to myself. I strive to work hard every day and make the most of the opportunities that come my way, all while staying true to my values and beliefs.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe that individuality is essential to achieving success and fulfillment in life.

Some people think that homework helps students learn better and prepare for tests, but others think it's just a waste of time. In my opinion, homework is helpful, but it should be used in moderation.\\n\\nOne reason homework is helpful is that it helps students practice what they learned in class. For example, if we learn about fractions in math class, a homework assignment might ask us to solve a few fraction problems. This helps us remember how to do it better and build our confidence. It also prepares us for tests and quizzes, which are really important for us to do well in school.\\n\\nAnother reason homework is helpful is that it teaches us responsibility and time management skills. When we have homework, we have to make sure to do it on time and turn it in on time. This helps us learn how to plan our time and prioritize our work. It's also good practice for when we grow up and have to meet deadlines for work or other responsibilities.\\n\\nHowever, too much homework can be really stressful for students. Sometimes, homework can take up a lot of our time and make it hard for us to do other things we enjoy, like play sports, hang out with friends, or just relax. This can make us feel overwhelmed and stressed out, which isn't good for our mental health.\\n\\nFurthermore, homework can be unfair for some students. For example, some students might not have a quiet place to do their homework at home, or they might not have access to the internet or other resources they need. This can make it hard for them to keep up with their classmates and do well in school.\\n\\nTo solve these problems, I think homework should be used in moderation. This means that teachers should give us enough homework to practice what we learned in class, but not so much that it takes up all our time. They should also make sure that the homework is fair and doesn't put some students at a disadvantage. For example, they could give us online resources or extra help in class if we need it.\\n\\nIn conclusion, homework is an essential part of learning, but it shouldn't be used too much. It's important to find a balance between homework and other things that are important for us, like our mental health and our personal interests. By using homework in moderation and making sure it's fair, we can learn what we need to know and still have time for other things we enjoy.\",\n",

When first meeting somebody, you don\\'t always get the right thoughts about that specific person. Once knowing somebody personally your thoughts start changing, your mind starts messing up on thinking \"What should I think about this person?\". Due to my past experience I always have luck to my first opinion changing to a good opinion after getting to know them. I always ask my friends what were there thoughts of me when they met me for the very first time and all of my friends would always tell me that I look like I was mean and not very kind. After, they\\'re opinions later changed once they got to me personally, knowing my personality and knowing how kind I am. My friends were very suprised.\\n\\nSecond, I would insists of not always having a first opinion on when seeing somebody for the first time because that usually is never how the person actually is. First imperssions always depend on the person on how there feeling or just based of anything that can be said.\\n\\nSecond impressions always get more better once they seen each other at least ones.\\n\\nThird,\\n\\nI would like to speak on my past experiences with this statement on why I disagree with this reasoning. When I was a couple years younger I had some very means thing said about me in middle school due to a couple of very mean people. Due to those sayings and rumors a various amount of people knew about me and the stuff that was said about me. People thought they already know me through thick and thin but in reality they really didn\\'t.

I like to get treated on how I treat others. First impressions are never good that\\'s why it\\'s never good to get based off that.

       " 'The use of this technology to read students\\' emotional expressions is a good idea. I think this is a good idea because say a student was having a bad day at school, the computer can tell if you are having a bad day and so the teacher wouldnt ask any questions, try to make you stand infront of the class reading a book or doing a math problem on the board. This technology will help both the student and the teacher have a better and more understanding relationship.\\n\\nThis article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile.\" shows many examples or evidence that support my claim like; \" The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,\" observes Dr. Huang, \"even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression\" (like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements--in a real face or in the paited face of the Mona Lisa. Another example supporting my claim is \" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" Dr. Huang predicts. \" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\"\\n\\nThis is a great and fun way to use technology, it will help teachers modify their lessons to fit not only the schools need of teaching but the students way of learning. The students will no longer be confused about an assignment instead, they will be able to learn and grow better than if they was in a regular classroom. This is why I think we should have Facial Action Coding System in our classrooms. ',\n",
       " \"Our understanding of the world is never static and is constantly shifting and evolving, and Ralph Waldo Emerson's quote reflects this. He argues that in a world that is constantly suggesting changes in order to fit in, being true to one's own self is an incredibly difficult, yet highly rewarding accomplishment. \\n\\nOne real-life example that serves as an embodiment of Emerson's quote is Mahatma Gandhi. Despite immense pressure to conform to the oppressive colonial rule of the British, Gandhi chose to stay true to his beliefs and values, leading India to independence without any bloodshed. Even in the toughest of circumstances, Gandhi stayed true to his convictions, which is a strong reflection of Emerson's sentiment.\\n\\nAnother example would be the renowned scientist Marie Curie. Despite living in a society that championed men’s scientific contributions over those of women, Curie continued to follow her passion for science and influenced many modern discoveries. She was incredibly successful in her field and gained recognition in a time where women were largely underrepresented in the field of science and were actively discouraged to explore their true potential.\\n\\nThese examples demonstrate the strength of Emerson's quote, as both Gandhi and Curie succeeded despite the attempts of the outside world to shape and mould them into something they were not. It is through the accomplishments of these inspiring individuals, as well as countless others, that we can understand the truth of Emerson's quote: that to be yourself - despite any obstacles that may arise - is truly the greatest accomplishment.\",\n",

       " 'The Electoral College system is not something American citezens should experiance. Theis system of voting has many flaws, even some of the top political leaders such as Rixhard Nixon or Jimmy Carter agree. I beleive that we should get rid of the electoral college system and change it to election by popular vote for president for these reasons, It is unfair to voters and the electoral college has a big disaster factor.\\n\\nThe electoral college system is very unfiar towards voters. Under this system voters aren\\'t even voting for president, rather they are voting for a slate of electors who vote for the president. Ins\\'t that the whole point of voting for president that you actually vote for president? Well under this system it is impossible. In source 2 it gives the example, \"If you lived in Texas, for instance, and you wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, you\\'d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes\". As show in this statement when voters want to vote for president they dont actually vote for president, in turn they vote for electoral votes. This defeats the whole purpose of Americans voting for their president. This goes against the American ideal that American is a Democracy in which people vote for their leaders. Another reason why this system is unfair to voters is because of its winner-take-all system in each state. According to source 2 \", candidates don\\'t spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states. During the 2000 capmpaign, seventeen states didn\\'t see the candidates at all,\" This in turn is unfair to those people in the states where candidates didn\\'t visit. As mentioned in source 1 \"Most states have a \"winner-take-all\" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate\". This statement is not at all fair. It is saying that the electors of the winning candidates team are rewarded while the other electors on the other side are not. How is this in any way fair towards the oposing teams electors? All of this is caused by the winner-take-all system caused by electoral college, which again is unfair to many American citizens.\\n\\nAnother reason why we should get rid of the electoral college system is because of its disaster factor. Americans should considers themselves lucky due to the whole 2000 election crisis which was the biggest in a century. This system allows for much worse to happen during these elections. Getting rid of it is one of the only ways to solve that problem. This system causes many problems, for example source 2 states \"Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy. P)\" This shows that this system has caused many mishaps in the past that could occur again. The American people should not be subject to these disasters. Another disaster factor that goes along with the electoral college system is that some electors have not voted for their own party, causing a disturbance in the voting. Source 2 states \"In the same vein, \"faithless\" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party\\'s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...\" In no way shape or form is this fair towards the candidates party\\'s. This infidelity can sway the predicted outcome of the election. Resulting in a surprise for many of America\\'s citizens when they see the voting results. This electoral college system can cause many different problems resulting in disasters. A few have already happened in the past, as mentioned, and America shouldn\\'t have to endure another one. This is why we should eliminate the electoral college system and change to election by popular vote for president.\\n\\nAll and all, the electoral college is unfiar and disasterous. It causes many issues with the voting for President in America. Many Americans believe that is system is definatly not working. This is why we need to change to election by popular vote. Famous politition Bob Dole one stated, \"Abolish the electoral college!\" and he seems to be right.       \\xa0    ',\n",
       " 'Hey, so for this essay, I gotta talk about first impressions and how they work in society. Like, have you ever met someone and they totally gave you a bad vibe, but then you get to know them and they\\'re actually cool? That\\'s what I\\'m gonna write about.\\n\\nSo, first impressions are like, super important, right? Like, they can make or break how people see you. If you walk into a room and people think you\\'re weird or whatever, it can be hard to change their minds. But, on the other hand, if you come in all confident and stuff, they might think you\\'re cool and wanna be your friend. It\\'s like, the old saying goes, \"You never get a second chance to make a first impression.\"\\n\\nBut, here\\'s the thing, sometimes people can change their minds about you. Like, if you have a bad first impression with someone, but then you start talking to them and you\\'re like, really funny or nice, they might start to see you in a different light. It\\'s like, they might not judge you based on one little thing you did or said.\\n\\nOne example of this is when I first met my best friend in school. I was like, totally nervous and didn\\'t know what to say, but then we started talking about music and we realized we had like, all the same favorite bands. So, even though I gave her a bad first impression, we were able to change it and become really close friends.\\n\\nAnother thing that can help change a negative first impression is if you\\'re able to show people that you\\'re not what they think you are. Like, if you\\'re in a group and someone thinks you\\'re the quiet one, but then you start talking and you\\'re like, really loud and funny, they might start to think you\\'re cooler than they thought.\\n\\nBut, sometimes it\\'s not easy to change a first impression. Like, if someone thinks you\\'re a jerk or something, it might be hard to change their mind. In that case, you might just have to prove it to them over time. Like, you could show them that you\\'re nice and stuff by being friendly and stuff.\\n\\nSo, in conclusion, first impressions are important,',\n",

Also if we would have thought that it actually was a atrifact from aliens then we wouldnt have made it public right away we would have went to go get more information, but the public wasnt satisfied so we went back and got them the information they wanted. Last but not least when we went back in April 8, 2001 (on a cloudless day) and took a picture it clearly showed that it was not built by alien lifeforms.\\n\\nWhen the pictures were took they were all taked in different time periods. In each picture they were different. In the first picture the face is clearly shown but we didnt get a clear enough picture, so we went back a second time to see take another one. In the second picture it is slightly hard to determened if the face is there or not. So of course we still werent satisfied, and yet again on April 8, 2001 we sent ANOTHER ship so take ANOTHER picture, i need to remind you this is on a cloudless day, and when the (multiple) pictures were taken, it was just some old hill with nothing special to it.\\n\\nA few days after recieving the picture NASA made it public! If we had truly thought that this was a \"Acient Artifact\" we would have kept it secret and not relised it publicly until after we (knew) that it was created by aliens. Which shows that we always knew it wasnt a alien artifact after all.\\n\\nI can see why most people had thought it was a acient alien artifact though. I mean most people dedicate their life finding out if there is more lifeforms out there. So most people had to have hope. For the sake of what they chose to do with there life.\\n\\nIn April 8, 2001 NASA went back to snap ANOTHER photo. This day (to remind you) was a cloudless day. So we knew it would be the perfect day to snap the finishing photo. The photo that would settle everything.

       " \"Technology has become an integral part of our daily lives. It has brought about numerous changes and has greatly impacted the way we live, work, and interact with others. While there are many positive effects of technology on people's lives, there are also potential negative impacts that must be considered.\\n\\nOne of the most significant benefits of technology is its ability to improve healthcare. Doctors and medical professionals use technology to diagnose and treat patients more efficiently and accurately. For example, medical imaging technology such as X-rays and MRIs allow doctors to see inside a person's body and diagnose conditions that may be difficult to detect through traditional methods. Additionally, technology such as electronic health records and telemedicine have made it easier for patients to access healthcare services and for doctors to communicate with each other.\\n\\nAnother area where technology has had a positive impact is in transportation. Airports, for example, use technology to streamline the check-in process and improve security measures. Additionally, technology such as GPS and ride-sharing apps have made it easier for people to get around and travel.\\n\\nIn the education sector, technology has also brought about significant changes. Schools are using technology to enhance the learning experience for students. For example, interactive whiteboards and online learning platforms have made it easier for teachers to deliver lessons and for students to access educational resources. Additionally, technology has made it possible for students to collaborate on projects and assignments with classmates and teachers from around the world.\\n\\nWhile there are many positive effects of technology on people's lives, there are also potential negative impacts that must be considered. One of the most significant concerns is the impact of technology on privacy and security. With the rise of social media and other online platforms, people are sharing more personal information than ever before. This information can be accessed by hackers and other malicious actors, putting individuals at risk of identity theft and other forms of cybercrime.\\n\\nAnother potential negative impact of technology is its effect on social skills and relationships. As people spend more time interacting with technology, they may become less adept at communicating with others face-to-face. This can lead to a decline in social skills and a reduction in the quality of relationships.\\n\\nWhen it comes to technology, it is important to consider the types of technology that are used in everyday life. These include smartphones, computers, televisions, and other electronic\",\n",
       " \"Summer break is all about fun and hanging out with friends. But it is important for students to continue to learn during this period. The smallest things can help students continue their education during break. This task can be made possible if students could design their own projects\\xa0rather than relying on the teachers. The summer projects should not be teacher-designed because instructors control class and projects during the school year. One project that is student-designed will give the students a turn to control the expectations and rubric. If students could manage and design their own projects, it would give them an opportunity to create something that expresses their interests while enjoying their summer break.\\n\\nWhen students are let out of school for summer break they are looking forward to the time off from school. The warm weather makes it fun to hang out with friends outdoors and go swimming. But if teachers were create and design a project for students to complete then that would be taking the fun out of summer break. It would be a hassle for students to be required to complete a teacher-designed project rather than the students designing the requirements and topic for the project. If the students have to take time out their summer to complete a project then it should designed by them. During the entire school year students are required to complete assignments at their instructors expense. Students are in school for more than half of the year, it is important that they can enjoy their lengthy summer break without being controlled by their teachers. If the students are required to complete a project during their summer break then it should be designed by the students. Summer break is meant to give students time to relax from stressful, hefty homework. It would be unfair to students if they were required to complete a project that was teacher-designed due to the importance for students to experience a stress-free break rather than worrying about due dates for assignments and tests.\\n\\nSummer work is no fun for any student. It will be hard to convince any student to continue their education during their summer break because summer is all about no homework or projects. A way around that issue is giving the students a chance to complete the project at their own pace and interest. Any summer projects or assignments for students should be based around their interest rather than teachers interest. During the summer students will be busy having fun with friends, going on vacation or enjoying their time off from school. If a teacher assigns students an assignment or project that is not appealing, the chances of the students putting 100% effort into the project is slim. Also, the chances of students actually completing a teacher-based project efficiently\\xa0is slim as well. But, if it was a student-designed project, the completion rate would skyrocket due to the fact the students would actually want to do the summer work. It will be hard for students to motivate and push themselves to complete a project if it is boring. Teacher-design summer work would be unfair to students that would like to control their education and topic. Projects and assignments based on the students interest would exemplify\\xa0better work ethic and dedication. It is important for students to continue learning during the summer, but it should be learning based on their interests and goals\\xa0rather than any teacher.\\n\\nIt would not be a good decision to let students design and control their own summer projects or assignments because it is important students are learning the correct material necessary for class. It would be pointless for students to complete a summer assignment or project if it was not based on the school's curriculum. A teacher-designed project would be more beneficial for the students than allowing the students to design their own project, The instructors are aware of the things the students will be required to learn during the school year. If the teachers would be allowed to control the summer work then it would give the students a head start\\xa0on the upcoming material in their classes. Overall, the teacher's should control the requirements and rubric for the summer work because the students would learn things that are related to school rather than researching things that are irrelevant to anything they would be exposed to during the school year.\\n\\nMoreover, students should be given the freedom to choose any topic for their summer work rather than letting the teachers design the projects. Summer is about free time and preparing for the next school year to come. But, if students had to worry and stress about a difficult, teacher-deigned project then it would be sucking the fun out of summer break. It would be unfair for teachers to require students to complete an assignment based on the instructors expectations. It would be easier for students to show their hobbies and interests through a project that they would enjoy rather than letting the instructor choose.\\xa0\",\n",
       " 'Dear senator,\\n\\nWhat are the chances in favor of keeping the electoral college or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states? Does the Electoral College work?\\n\\nFirst of all, What is the electoral college? The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.\\n\\nThe Electoral College process consists of the selection of the selectors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president,and the counting of the electoral votes by congress.\\n\\nWhat\\'s wrong with the electoral college? Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn the president. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all systemin each state, candidates don\\'t spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing on the tight races in the \"swing\"states. It\\'s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best\\xa0 arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.

       " \"Sure, here's my essay response:\\n\\nAs an 8th grader, I'm starting to think about my future career and profession. I want to be a video game designer, and I know I need to start preparing for it now. To research courses related to this career, I looked up different high schools and colleges that have strong video game design programs. I found out that some high schools even have their own game design clubs where students can work on projects together and learn from professionals in the field.\\n\\nI also investigated the experience required to be successful in the video game design industry. I found out that most video game designers have a bachelor's degree in computer science, graphic design, or a related field. They also need to have a good understanding of programming languages like Java and C++, as well as design software like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. To make progress towards my goals while in high school, I plan to take advanced math and computer science classes, as well as join the school's game design club to gain hands-on experience.\\n\\nOne advantage of focusing on video game design in high school is that it can help me build a strong portfolio of work to show to colleges and potential employers. It can also give me a head start on learning the skills and software I'll need to succeed in the industry. However, there are also some disadvantages to focusing on one career so early on. For example, if I change my mind about what I want to do, I may have wasted time and resources on a career that I'm not interested in anymore.\\n\\nOverall, I think it's important to start preparing for my future career in high school. By taking challenging classes and gaining hands-on experience, I can set myself up for success in the video game design industry. While there are some risks to focusing on one career so early on, I believe the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. With hard work and dedication, I know I can achieve my goal of becoming a successful video game designer.\",\n",

       " 'Ugh, do I really have to write an essay?  Okay, fine. Here it goes:\\n\\nSo, we\\'ve been talking about this thing in class where failure and success are like, connected or something.

I mean, it seems like they\\'re just, like, opposite things.\\n\\nBut then I started thinking about it, and I realized that failures can actually be really helpful. Like, think about it. If you don\\'t try something and it doesn\\'t work out, you can\\'t learn from it and make it better. But if you do try something and it does work out, you\\'re just, like, stuck with what you have. It\\'s like, you have to fail sometimes to figure out what works and what doesn\\'t.\\n\\nAnd it\\'s not just like, in school or something. It\\'s like, in life too. Like, if you don\\'t take risks and try new things, you\\'ll never know what could have been. But if you do take risks and it doesn\\'t work out, you can learn from it and do better next time.

I am also teaching you about clicking your seatbelt, so sit back and take notes.\\n\\nThe reason you should leave your phone alone, because you\\'re putting people in danger. For example \"say you\\'re driving and texting and take your eyes off the road, Then Boom! You just killed yourself and someone else.

       " \"Climate change has become a hot topic in recent years. It refers to the increase in the average temperature of Earth's atmosphere that is caused by the release of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, into the air. While some people believe that governments should take immediate action to address climate change, others argue that there are more pressing issues that need to be resolved first. In this essay, I will argue against the idea that governments should take immediate action to address climate change.\\n\\nFirstly, it is not entirely clear that climate change is caused by human activity. While there is evidence to suggest that the Earth's temperature is increasing, it is not clear whether this is due to natural climate cycles or human activity. There have been periods in Earth's history where the temperature has increased and then decreased again without any human intervention. Therefore, it is possible that the current increase in temperature is part of a natural cycle rather than something that humans can control.\\n\\nSecondly, addressing climate change requires huge amounts of money and resources. Governments need to invest in renewable energy technologies, such as wind turbines and solar panels, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, these technologies are expensive and require significant investment. In addition, many countries are still developing and do not have the resources to make such investments. As a result, it is not fair to ask these countries to bear the burden of addressing climate change when they are still struggling to meet their basic needs.\\n\\nFinally, there are more pressing issues that need to be addressed first. Poverty, unemployment, and hunger are just a few examples of issues that affect millions of people around the world. Governments need to focus on addressing these issues before they can turn their attention to climate change. After all, what good is a healthy planet if people are still suffering?\\n\\nIn conclusion, while climate change is an important issue, it is not clear that human activity is the cause. Addressing climate change would require massive investments of money and resources, which many countries simply cannot afford. Moreover, there are more pressing issues that need to be addressed first. Therefore, I argue that governments should not take immediate action to address climate change.\",\n",

You decide it is time to get some advice, but you don\\'t know who to ask. Should you ask your best friend, a family member, or even that smart classmate who always gets her work done early? Well, why should you only ask just one person?\\n\\nThere are many reasons why asking for advice from multiple people is better than asking just one. For example, you\\'re asking how to get motovated enough to clean your room. Someone might tell you to \"fake it until you make it\", but that might not work for you so you decide to ask someone else for advice. They tell you to view it as a goal you\\'re trying to acheive, rather than a chore. You decide to give it a try and next thing you know your room is sparkling clean! Sometimes what works for one person does not work for others. Everyone is unique and different things work for different people, sometimes asking multiple people for advice can help you find what works for you.\\n\\nAnother reason you should seek advice from multiple people is so you are exposed to new options and ideas. Sometimes we only see one solution to a problem and talking to other people can help you see all of the options you have. Talking to people can open you up to new options and ideas. This can help you make a decision that will be better for you in the long run.\\n\\nWhen you are seeking advice from other people the same solution might come up multiple times.\\n\\nSometimes people suggest what works for them, and if many people suggest the same thing you might want to try it out to see if it works to you. Sometimes this will also happen when others see a solution you might have overlooked. Sometimes we overthink things and the answer is more obvious than we thought.\\n\\nLastly, when you look for advice from more than one person, more people will know what you are going through. People will be able to listen and relate to what you are going through, and you will have people to turn to when you need help. Sometimes all we need is a little support to motovate us.\\n\\nSo if you are looking for advice, then you should ask more than one person. This way you can find solutions that work for you, see options you didn\\'t know you had, see what others would do in your situation and find people that will motovate and support you.',\n",
       " 'Have you ever been bored by the dull contents of school?\\xa0Schools are normally the same everyday, which can cause one to feel as if their life is on repeat.\\xa0It can feel droning and never-ending with each passing day. More often than not, children need something to break up\\xa0the repetitive cycle of everyday school. Students should participate in extracurricular activities because they bring out one\\'s talents, help one to make real friends, and give students something to look forward to.\\n\\nFirst off, extracurricular activities can help bring out a student\\'s talents. School is a \"one size fits all\" kind of approach, and most students don\\'t always fit in the mold. Each kid finds interest in a different thing or skill. For instance, I took a painting class when I was in the 3rd grade. Painting is now something I do, almost daily, for relaxation and fun. Another example is, my friend Generic_Name started playing soccer when she was in kindergarten. Since then, she has become the captain\\xa0of an amazing team that made it to nationals last year. Soccer is her passion and she has grown into a great player.\\n\\nSecond, extracurricular activities help kids make new friends. They \"funnel\" students into separate interest groups making it easier to create conversations. Kids are also able to make connections through this shared topic of interest. For instance, I play field hockey and I have to try out to make a team. At my last tryout, a seemingly nice girl approached me and asked how long I had been playing for. She started a simple conversation with a topic that we both love, and made a connection between the two of us. Another example is, my cousin plays softball and was invited to a sleep away\\xa0camp. At first, she was anxious about not having anyone to talk to. After that weekend away, she came back she told me all about her new friends that she had met through this camp, doing something they all enjoy.\\n\\nLastly, extracurricular activities give students something to look forward to. School is generally not an event that students look forward to in a positive manner. Extracurricular activities can be looked forward to with a smile due to the fact that it is participated in because of the student\\'s interests. For example, I look forward to field hockey. I love going to practices to see my friends and going to \"away\" tournaments to play with teams from everywhere. Another instance is, my little sister and cross fit. My sister recently started cross fit\\xa0and she loves it. Every Wednesday, she goes and sees all of her friends and comes home with the biggest smile. On Tuesday nights she excitedly talks with my mom saying things like, \"We have to get there on time tomorrow, I almost missed the warm ups.\"\\n\\nIn conclusion, extracurricular activities are beneficial to students in many different ways. Students can develop life long talents and passions as well as life long friends that share your interests. These activities can also be looked at like a special event to liven up one\\'s day to day life. Extracurricular activities are interesting and still maintain the ability to brighten up any average school day.',\n",
       " 'I believe that there should be stricter gun control laws in our country. The reason for this is because of the increasing number of gun-related incidents and crimes that have been happening lately.\\n\\nFirstly, stricter gun control laws can help reduce the number of deaths caused by guns. In countries where there are strict gun laws, such as Japan and Australia, there are significantly fewer gun-related deaths compared to countries with more lenient laws like the United States. This shows that having stricter laws can make a difference in saving lives.\\n\\nSecondly, stricter gun control laws can help prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands. For example, people with a history of mental illness or criminal records should not be allowed to own guns. By implementing stricter background checks and waiting periods, we can ensure that only responsible and law-abiding citizens are able to purchase firearms.\\n\\nLastly, stricter gun control laws can help reduce the number of mass shootings that occur. In recent years, there have been numerous mass shootings in schools, movie theaters, and other public places. By limiting access to certain types of guns and ammunition, we can make it harder for individuals to carry out these types of attacks.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that there should be stricter gun control laws in our country. By implementing these laws, we can help save lives, prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands, and reduce the number of mass shootings that occur. It is time for our government to take action and prioritize the safety of its citizens.',\n",

In this essay, I will explore the numerous advantages of engaging in these activities and how they can positively impact one's overall well-being.\\n\\nFirstly, participating in sports can provide individuals with a sense of physical and mental well-being. Exercise is essential for maintaining a healthy body, and engaging in sports can help individuals achieve this while also providing a fun and enjoyable way to stay active. Furthermore, physical activity has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety, which can have a positive impact on mental health.\\n\\nIn addition to the physical and mental benefits, engaging in sports can also provide individuals with a sense of community and belonging. Team sports, in particular, require individuals to work together towards a common goal, which can foster a sense of camaraderie and collaboration. This can be particularly beneficial for individuals who may struggle with social interactions or feel isolated in other areas of their lives.\\n\\nAnother benefit of participating in sports is the development of important life skills, such as discipline, teamwork, and leadership. These skills can be applied to other areas of one's life, such as school or work, and can help individuals succeed in their personal and professional endeavors.\\n\\nIn addition to sports, music can also be an enjoyable way for individuals to express themselves. Participating in music can provide individuals with a creative outlet and a way to connect with others who share their interests.

       " 'Learning is an essential part of growing up. Throughout history, educators have sought to equip students with the skills, knowledge, and values necessary to take part in society. The idea of allowing students to be responsible for their own education with minimal oversight by teachers is an intriguing concept to explore. \\n\\nOn one hand, such a system could allow students to take greater control of their own learning experience, diversify their curriculum to more accurately match their individual interests, and encourage them to develop self-discipline as they manage their own progress. Students may find this approach more stimulating and exciting than a traditional education, leading to better engagement and improved academic achievement. \\n\\nOn the other hand, without appropriate oversight, students may lack guidance and support when they encounter difficult topics or have difficulty learning independently. They may end up focusing solely on topics that interest them, leaving gaps in their knowledge. In addition, self-directed learning can be difficult to sustain, and lack of structure and accountability could demotivate students and lead to less successful outcomes. \\n\\nAllowing students to be responsible for their own education is a complex idea with potential benefits and drawbacks. Educators must consider the type of structure and resources required to provide appropriate support and guidance for self-directed students, while not stifling their creativity and enthusiasm for learning.',\n",
       " 'Student Evaluations of Teachers: For or Against?\\n\\nThe idea that students should have the power to grade their teachers has been a hotly debated topic in recent years, with proponents arguing that it promotes accountability and transparency while also giving students an active voice in their education. However, there are also valid concerns about the reliability of student evaluations and the potential for biases and personal vendettas to come into play. In this essay, I will argue against the practice of student evaluations of teachers, highlighting specific reasons and examples to support my position.\\n\\nTo begin with, one of the main arguments against student evaluations of teachers is that they can be highly subjective and unreliable. Students may base their opinions on a range of factors, including personal relationships with the teacher, perceived fairness or leniency in grading, and even superficial factors like appearance and demeanor. For instance, if a teacher is known to have a tough grading policy, they may receive low marks from students regardless of their actual effectiveness as an educator. Similarly, if a teacher is well-liked by their students, they may receive higher ratings even if they are not particularly skilled at conveying information or facilitating learning.\\n\\nFurthermore, some students may have personal biases and prejudices that cloud their judgment when evaluating their teachers. These biases may be based on factors such as race, gender, or religion, and could unfairly impact the ratings that certain teachers receive. For example, a student who holds prejudiced views against people of color may give a lower rating to a teacher of a different race, regardless of their actual performance as an educator. Similarly, a student who is biased against certain religious beliefs may give a lower rating to a teacher of that particular faith, even if they are highly qualified and effective in their role.\\n\\nIn addition to concerns about bias and subjectivity, there is also a risk that student evaluations of teachers could be misused or abused. For example, some students may deliberately give low ratings to teachers who they dislike or who they believe have treated them unfairly in some way. Alternatively, students may give artificially high ratings to certain teachers in an attempt to curry favor or gain special treatment. In either case, the integrity of the evaluation process could be compromised, and the results may not accurately reflect the actual effectiveness of the teacher in question.\\n\\nDespite these concerns, some proponents of student evaluations of teachers argue that they can be a valuable tool for promoting accountability and transparency in the education system. For instance, if a teacher',\n",

Internships are also an important source of experience and knowledge, as they can offer a range of skills and expertise that cannot be taught. With all this in mind, it is important to help the student find a job or path that interests them and will help them develop their skills further.

Without your eyes on the road, how can driverless cars be safe? The Author of \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" gives examples of how driverless cars can result in being late, more expensive, and more acciddents.\\n\\nIn the story \" Driverless Cars Are Coming\" paragraph three, states many companies that have started making these driverless cars. One being General Motors, whose idea was towards \"Smart Roads\". Having smart roads would be rediculous becuase of the expensises in using magnets and the special car sensor needed. If we had smart raods, and the road broke, what would we do? Basing all of our driving on a \"Smart Road\" would increase the risk of it breaking and everyone being late.\\n\\nOkay, so smart raods are a terrible idea. What about smart cars? Google came out with a Toyota Prius. The prius uses postion-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a roatating senor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automatic radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor. Sounds cool right? There are a couple problems with all of this stuff on a car. The first problem being that if one thing broke it would be super expensive. the second problem being if one thing broke nobodywould be able to drive at all. The last problem with all of the gudgets on the car is having the extra weight on the car would make the gas milage go through the roof.\\n\\nSo, smart roads and smart cars are starting to sound like a bad idea. Still can not make up your mind? Take the human mind as a consideration. These smart cars would make humans lazy. If we had these driverless cars we would not pay any attention to whats going on on the road. In the story \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" paragraph eight reads \" some manufacturers hope to bring in-car entertainment. Think about what would happen if a car had a malfunction, would the other riders in the driverless cars be paying attention? Think about if a kid ran in the street after thier ball, would the car or the driver know? Finally, think about how much boring the world would be if you only rode in the car not drove it? Would you see the the beautiful blue sky or the amazing adventure of the forest? No, you wpould not. The little things are what make driving such a privledge not a right.\\n\\nIn conclusion, driverless cars are not a good idea. As people, we should always look ahead at what is in front of us. In \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\", the author states both good and bad ideas of the driverless cars, I encourge you to think about the little things and the bad thing, on why we should not allow driverless cars.

       " \"Eating healthier foods is becoming increasingly important in today's society, especially among students. With the rise of childhood obesity and other health problems, it is crucial that schools provide healthy food options to their students. In this essay, I will research the benefits of eating healthier foods in school compared to junk food, identify the most popular healthier snacks among students, and create a plan to implement healthier food options into school cafeterias.\\n\\nFirst, let's examine the benefits of eating healthier foods in school. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), children who eat healthy foods are more likely to maintain a healthy weight, have better academic performance, and have a lower risk of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Additionally, eating healthier foods can improve a student's mental health, as they are more likely to have better concentration and focus.\\n\\nNow that we have established the benefits of eating healthier foods, it's important to identify the most popular healthier snacks among students. Some of the most popular healthier snacks include fresh fruit, vegetables, yogurt, and whole-grain crackers. These snacks are not only healthy, but also delicious and satisfying, making them a great choice for students.\\n\\nTo implement healthier food options into school cafeterias, I propose the following plan:\\n\\n1. Increase the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables in the cafeteria. This can be done by partnering with local farmers to provide fresh produce, or by offering pre-cut fruit and vegetable trays.\\n\\n2. Offer more whole-grain options, such as whole-grain bread, pasta, and crackers. These options are not only healthier, but also more filling and satisfying than their refined counterparts.\\n\\n3. Reduce the availability of junk food, such as chips, candy, and soda. While these foods may be popular among students, they are not healthy and contribute to a host of health problems. By reducing their availability, students will be more likely to choose healthier options.\\n\\n4. Provide education and resources to help students make healthy choices. This can include nutrition information on menus, taste tests of healthy foods, and educational materials on the importance of eating healthy.\\n\\nIn conclusion, eating healthier foods in school is\",\n",

While students may appreciate the extra day to rest and recharge, teachers may struggle to keep up with the workload and maintain a consistent schedule. Additionally, the energy and resource savings that result from a school day off may not be as significant as they appear.\\n\\nOn one hand, taking one day off of school can provide students with much-needed rest and relaxation. This can lead to increased productivity and focus when they return to class, as well as improved mental and physical health. Moreover, a day off can give students a chance to catch up on any work they may have fallen behind on, or to pursue extracurricular activities that they may not have had time for otherwise.\\n\\nHowever, taking one day off of school can also have negative consequences. Teachers may struggle to keep up with the workload that results from a school day off, such as grading papers, preparing for upcoming lessons, and communicating with students and parents. This can lead to increased stress and burnout, as well as a potential decrease in the quality of instruction.\\n\\nAdditionally, the energy and resource savings that result from a school day off may not be as significant as they appear. While students and teachers may appreciate the extra day to rest and recharge, the impact on the environment and the school's resources may be minimal. This is particularly true if the school is already operating efficiently and using energy-efficient technologies.\\n\\nIn conclusion, taking one day off of school can have both positive and negative effects on students and teachers. While students may appreciate the extra day to rest and recharge, teachers may struggle to keep up with the workload and maintain a consistent schedule. Additionally, the energy and resource savings that result from a school day off may not be as significant as they appear.

       " \"Extracurricular activities are very important to not only your success at school but also your success in life. Not only does being in a club or sport help you grow, it also affects how colleges and bosses see you as a person. Participating in extracurricular activities can open many doors such as, acquiring new skills, becoming a more well rounded person, and meeting new people which can also lead to new opportunities.\\n\\nIn life your going to meet many people, some will stick with you and some won't, but you will learn something from each and everyone of them. Extracurricular activities will lead you to meet all of the different people in your school that may share some of the same interest as you. For example maybe a student decides to join the lacrosse team and none of your friends do. The student ends up meeting lots of people who also like trucks and fishing and hunting. If the student would not have participated an extracurricular activity, they would have never met their new friends. Another way doing clubs and sports will help you is the teachers or coaches getting to know you. For instance say an eight grader joins the art club, the art teacher never really knew you before. But, since you have been going to the club the whole year, the art teacher loves your attitude and thinks you are very talented . Then you are picking you classes for high school and you want to do a photography class, but you need you are teachers recommendation. The student that was in\\xa0the club is more likely to get a recommendation than the kid who just took art. Meeting new people who also may give you new opportunities is a essential and will help throughout life.\\n\\nAccumulating a new skill happens almost everyday to everybody. A skill can range from a way to write a story to a new way to shoot a basketball. In life you obtain so many skills and being in different clubs or activities can help you\\xa0share them among many people. For example, a student joins the yearbook club. The student has never really been very good with computers, but is really good with cameras. Many of the students who are in that club are great at editing, but dont have great camera skills. With both of the student skills put together they work perfectly, but also the can teach the skills to one another. Another skill that is\\xa0acquired through any club or sport you decide to do is, how to interact with others. There are many shy people but also many loud people. A shy person can view a very actively talking person and find new skill and maybe they wont be as shy because they know how to start a conversation and since they are in a extracurricular activities with people that share the same interest as them, they will be able to talk about club related subjects. Lastly, someone can learn how to play a sport. A large number of people play a sport, but usually not every sport. So, a student could give a different sport you don't play a shot. Maybe there is a student that runs track, swims, plays soccer and field hockey. But, they decide to play volleyball. Since they are required to do a club or sport they made this decision, but if they were not required to they most likely would have not tried anything new. Once they started playing the learned many skills and ended up being one of the best on the team. Making extracurricular activities mandatory could be beneficial to a lot\\xa0of students and might even help hem find their true talent.\\n\\nA well-rounded human being can have different definitions, but usually it means someone who can balance. Not the kind of balance of standing or walking across a tightrope, but more like having loads of work\\xa0to do and getting it done quickly and quietly. It also means to be someone who helps others, which can range from friends to your whole community. At some schools there is Student Council Association and Youth Volunteer Corps. Both Student Council Association\\xa0and Youth Volunteer Corps help the community and are extracurricular activities. These two clubs usually have people that are caring and want to help others in it, but they\\xa0also have good grades and manage to do\\xa0other activities. Another way student are well rounded is when they have multiple friends. While they usually have a few close friends they are also friendly and easily can make friends with anyone who sits with them. With extracurricular activities they could make even more friends or just be nice\\xa0to someone\\xa0new. They could also share their actions with new people who might decide\\xa0to be more like the well rounded student. Finally, they can be friends with the teachers. To build a relationship with the teacher you can join a club that is run by a teacher. It is hard to talk to teachers during class and get to know them. But, once it is the club time and they can talk to a student with fewer people and where the don't have to teach, the student can actually get to know the teacher. This can be helpful in many way, they can understand your way of learning and be able to help you better and like what was mentioned before they can help with a recommendation for school or\\xa0even maybe a job. Without extracurricular activities people wouldnt be able to be as well rounded as they could potentially be because they wouldn't be able to connect with others.\\n\\nExtracurricular activities could help so many people in all kinds of ways. While their could be some problems with depletion of time, obtaining the skill or even the amount of school work they have to do after. There is ways around those kind of problems and they could easily be fixed. Joining clubs and sports teams can be very beneficial to everyone involved and learning new skills, meeting new people and becoming a well rounded person is just a few reasons to make extracurricular activities mandatory.\",\n",

       " 'Author Ralph Emerson wrote, \"To be yourself in a world that that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.\" He is totally wrong because to be yourself in a world and make the greatest accomplishment in your life, the wold do not have to take control over you liberty, you should take control over the world to accomplish whats you are going to be. Author Ralph Waldo Emerson did not think before writing these letter because to be yourself in a world, you should have to make your own decisions, do something that you would like to do, and being your self not letting the world to take control over your life.\\n\\nFirst thing,\\n\\nbe yourself and never give the right to the world. To make that happen you should have to make your own decisions, because if you let the world to choose for you in the future you may get lost and tire about your life, because you let the world to take control over your life, and for not choosing your own decision. Being your self and not letting the world to try to make something else, is something that will bring goods in your future, because is something that you choose and you know why did you took it and why did you choose it. However, the peoples that let the wold to choose for them they will get tire about life.\\n\\nThe second thing for accomplishment; and not letting the world to control you,is being your self and do what you like to do, never letting the world to do whatever it wants to do with you. If you want to do the greatest accomplishment in your life you should take something that you that you like to do. because when you do something that you like to do you will never going to get tire about doing it, when you like to do something and you wanted to be the greatest accomplishment, you are not going to feel that job like a job because is something that you like to do. But to make that happen and accomplish that dream. never led the world to do what ever it wants with you.\\n\\nBeing your self and not letting the world to take control over your life, the best choice that you can do, because being yourself and choose your own decision will help you to know what to do,what\\'s good , what\\'s bad, what career to choose, and what goal to accomplish because the only person who know all about you is you. So you should not let the world to ruin their life, and take their own decisions and tell the world that you can do it in your own. Lots of people let the world to choose for them and in future they ruin their life and they don\\'t know whats to do for not choosing the correct choice and because they let the world to choose for them.\\n\\nIn conclusion, never led the world to change your life . because if you led the world to choose for you you will never going to get satisfy. Always be your self because if you led the world to choose for you will have a bad and sad feature for for not choosing the right decision. Always do a things what you like to do, like sports or a profession that you would like to be, if you choose things that you like you never going to feel it like a job. sometime you let the world to choose for you, but in the future you will get bored because you did not choose what you like. If you want to make real the greatest accomplishment, never led the world to change you.',\n",
       " \"Summer projects can allow students to focus on something, school related, while on summer break. Which is good because it keeps the school juices flowing in their brain and it gives the student something to do rather than staying at home doing nothing. When the students are at home during their summer break, most of what they learn during the school year is out the door, in about a month. Summer projects can be a bit too much when they are assigned by a teacher rather than the actual student. Summer projects should be designed by the students rather than the teacher because it allows the students to express their own ideas more and the students can be more interested/enthusiastic about the project.\\n\\nTo begin with, students should design their own summer project because it allows the students to express their own ideas more. For example, an 11 year old boy loves to draw, paint, and write and doesn't really get to show his talents off in school because he is afraid his friends won't treat him the same the way. His school always assigns each student to create their own project during the summer. When its the last day of school hits he gets excited and anxious because he knows he can be able to start thinking about his summer project. His creative ideas start to flow in as soon as he is released from school. He starts to write down his ideas that he thinks would be good to do during the summer break. His idea is to make a huge painting of his school and decides to write a poem to go along with it. It's the first day of school and he comes to school with his project ready to show it off to his new teacher. His teacher starts to cry because she had never seen such art before and how beautiful his poem was. She gives him a 100 on his project as she wipes her face off and tells him he should go put that in an art museum because it had looked like a professional artist had did his project. This example shows why it is important to have students create their own projects. Students can end up being as good as anybody they put their mind too when it comes to creating their own ideas. Without them being able to express their own ideas, people won't be able to see how creative their child can actual be. Students should design their own project because it allows the students to express their own ideas more.\\n\\nPrimarily, students should design their own project because the student can be more interested/enthusiastic about the project. For example, a student is assigned a summer project by the teacher at the end of school. The student goes online to see what the project is about. The student is anxious because they havent done a good project in a while. They read about what they have to do and ends up not liking the project at all. The student isn't interested\\xa0and knows they are going to get a bad grade on it because the student doesn't do well on any projects they get assigned to them that the student doesn't like. It's almost the beginning of school and the student turns the project in and gets a C on it. The student know's that if they were able to create their own project that they would have gotten a way better grade on it. This shows that if the student was to create\\xa0their own project that they would have been interested in it and would have gotten a better grade on it. Students being able to create their own summer projects gives them more space to create and think about ideas on their own without someone else creating an idea for them. Students should design their own projects because it can allow the students\\xa0to be more interested/enthusiastic about the project.\\n\\nTo conclude summer projects should be designed by the students rather than the teacher because it allows the students to express their own ideas more and the students can be more interested/enthusiastic about the project. Students being able to create their own project gives them some kind of responsibility and ownership of their project. Without that students won't be able to express that kind of ownership until they get out of house or in high school. However, if students are able to create their own project they can make the project easy, therefore they wouldn't have to work as hard as they would, if someone created the project for them. Allowing the students to create their own projects can be risky, but it gives them that responsibility and ownership that they might need.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0   \\xa0\\xa0\",\n",

       " \"I'm headed to my first soccer practice, with no experience. The butterflies in my stomach start to rumble as I exit the car, due to the fact that I have never participated in any kind of sport. The coach lines everyone up to shoot the first shot of his or her season. I shoot... I score! Guess my opinion was wrong about activities. Ever since my new principle was hired at school, lots of changes were made. The most well being rule was that extracurricular activities were now required. When the students heard about the new action made, the school went wild. However, I support the principle's new idea. Whether it's sports or clubs, in my opinion, requiring at least one activity can provide the opportunity to try new academics, benefit college applications, and boost social status.\\n\\nFurthermore, extracurricular activities provide an opportunity to try something new. Due to technology, a lot of kids have become lazy over the years. Even doing the slightest favor can seem hard, like washing the dishes. Now a day children need to be active more than ever. It all starts from trying something new, like a sport or club. For instance, many kids fear the lack of talent in activities, however, trying new professions may just reveal a secret inner talent. When an adolescent is required to participate in an activity, he or she cannot refuse. In addition, the requirement may motivate kids to try harder in\\xa0their\\xa0specific activity. Not only motivation, but individuals can discover new interests from performing multiple professions. For example, after children try\\xa0multiple\\xa0activities, they can analyze which one was the most appealing to them. In the aftermath, extracurricular\\xa0activities would defiantly provide the opportunity to try new ideas.\\n\\nMore seriously, participating in many activities can benefit college applications. When it comes to college, many people seem to think about grades. For example, many parents believe that if their kid has perfect grades then they are assured a spot at Generic_School. However, that is not really the case. Colleges mainly look for active, involved, and hard working students. For instance, participating in sports, clubs, after school\\xa0activities, and community service may get a student recognized more than others. It is all about being unique and standing out the most. For instance, receiving rewards from a category is very crucial, because on college applications, rewards can be expressed to get noticed. To end with, when kids don't have an interest or activity to participate in, it could affect them negatively, or positively in the future.\\n\\nFinally, activities can provide certain individuals with social opportunity. Many children lack friends, especially anti-social kids. However, participating in activities that someone else relates to, may help start conversations. In addition, close friend groups can be formed. For example, joining a school sports team would provide the opportunity to hang out with the team, and when you are on a team, everybody treats each other\\xa0like family. Close bonds are made whenever people can relate to each other. Instead of making online friends through virtual reality, kids should be making real, close friends. The kind of friends that can count on each other in the future. However, not all friends benefit an individual. For instance, if somebody is influencing others in a poor manner, those are the kind of people to stay away from. Kids should always be aware of who they talk to.\\n\\nIn conclusion, some people may disagree or agree with the fact of extracurricular activities. However, in my perspective, I believe that extra curricular activities are important. By not participating, people really miss out on new opportunities, futures, and friendships. Unless someone is unable to commit due to time, money, or health, kids should defiantly be required to be involved in the extracurricular activities.   \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\",\n",

       " \"In today's world, it is often said that having a positive attitude is the key to success and happiness. However, I believe that this is not entirely true. While a positive attitude can certainly help individuals navigate through difficult situations, it is not the only factor that determines the outcome. In fact, there are many instances where having a positive attitude can actually hinder one's ability to cope with adversity.\\n\\nOne example of this can be seen in the case of breakups. When someone experiences a breakup, it can be incredibly difficult to maintain a positive attitude, especially when the other person is actively trying to make the relationship as difficult as possible. In these situations, it is important for individuals to acknowledge their emotions and allow themselves to feel the pain of losing someone they care about. By doing so, they can begin to heal and move forward in a healthier way.\\n\\nSimilarly, losing someone close can be an incredibly challenging experience. While it may be tempting to try and maintain a positive attitude in order to avoid feeling overwhelmed, this can actually make the grieving process more difficult. It is important for individuals to allow themselves to feel the full range of emotions that come with losing a loved one, in order to properly process and heal from the experience.\\n\\nFurthermore, the prevalence of bad people in today's world cannot be ignored. While having a positive attitude can certainly help individuals navigate through difficult situations, it cannot protect them from the actions of others. In many cases, individuals may encounter people who are intentionally trying to bring them down or cause them harm. In these situations, it is important for individuals to remain vigilant and take steps to protect themselves, regardless of their attitude.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while having a positive attitude can certainly be helpful in many situations, it is not the only factor that determines the outcome.

Many individuals think that studying Venus up close is too dangerous, whereas others disagree and think risks should be made. In the article, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author thinks studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers, but does not support this idea very well.\\n\\nThe author describes the potential dangers that could result from studying Venus which contradicts their idea that the observations made through studying Venus overweigh the risks. The author is aware of the fact and describes how, \"no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours\" (paragraph 2). Right off the bat, the author gives their audience the mindset that it is not a good idea to study Venus. Having that fact in the first few paragraphs of the article sets the tone for the rest of the article. In paragraph three, the author goes into great detail about several of the potential dangers that can come from studying Venus because of its, \"clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid\" (paragraph 3). The frightening environment described strays the audience even further away from believing that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Not only does the author describe why dangers are present on the planet Venus, but they also gives analogies in regards to the danger present including the fact that, \"such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans\" (paragraph 3). At this point in the article, the idea of having a human explore and study Venus up close in unthinkable. The author tries to justify the dangers by explaining technology that will be used in order to allow individuals to study Venus. The author describes, \"a vehicle hovering over Venus\" (paragraph 5). At first, the technological advances that could be made sound like a good idea, but the author goes on to say how, \"tempertaures would still be toasty at around 170 degress Fahrenheit\" (paragraph 5). This fact completely shuts down the idea of the hovering vehicle. The author contradicts their ideas by explaining the dangers in depth and giving reason as to why studying Venus is not a good idea.\\n\\nFrom the very first descriptions of the idea the author is trying to bring across, the audience is turned away from the author\\'s opinion. The tone set sways the audience toward one direction of the conflict while the author is in the other direction. The author went too far into detail about the dangers that can come from studying Venus and di not have evidence of how it would be safe and possible at all.

This requires creativity and brainstorming, which can be challenging for some students. However, by encouraging them to think outside the box and come up with unique ideas, they can develop their creativity.\\n\\nOnce the concept is finalized, the next step is to gather the necessary materials.

By engaging in the creative process, they can develop their self-confidence and self-expression skills.

I believe that Thomas Jefferson, one of the founding fathers of the United States, had a similar view on this matter. In his letter to John Adams, Jefferson wrote, \"I am a firm believer in the necessity of retirement, and of recreation, and of solitude, and of repose.\" This quote suggests that Jefferson believed that taking breaks and engaging in inactivity was important for personal growth and well-being.\\n\\nWhile it is true that being always doing something can lead to productivity, it can also lead to burnout and exhaustion. When we are constantly working, we may become so focused on our tasks that we neglect our own needs and well-being. This can lead to physical and mental health problems, such as stress, anxiety, and depression. On the other hand, engaging in inactivity can provide us with a much-needed break from our daily routines and give us time to recharge and refresh our minds.\\n\\nOne of the consequences of inactivity is that it can lead to a lack of motivation. When we are not engaged in any activities, we may feel unfulfilled and unproductive. This can lead to a lack of drive to accomplish anything, which can be detrimental to our personal growth and development. However, there are strategies that we can use to motivate ourselves to engage in productive activities.\\n\\nOne strategy is to set goals for ourselves. By setting specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals, we can give ourselves a sense of purpose and direction. This can help us to stay motivated and focused on our tasks. Additionally, we can break our goals down into smaller, more manageable tasks, which can help us to feel more accomplished and motivated.\\n\\nAnother strategy is to choose our activities wisely. It is important to distinguish between idle activities and productive activities. Idle activities, such as watching TV or scrolling through social media, may provide temporary distraction, but they do not contribute to personal growth or development.

But, from my recent discovery it might not be as well thought out and fair as we thought.\\n\\nI was just informed that i'm not really voting for the president, i am voting for the official voter that will then, in turn vote for the president(Using their own biases). Since i was not aware of this, i am quite shocked. I'm assuming that this is just something that gets passed by or not looked at very deeply, but i willbe that person that digs down and gets all up in the business of somone other than myself.\\n\\nThis is offical: The electoral colllege is unfair, oudated and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without a basis in reality. Yes, The electoral college does avoid the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast but, either way the method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state anyways.\\n\\nThank you for your time,\\n\\nPROPER_NAME   \",\n",

Let's say you're in your classroom and there's a lockdown. The bad guy is at the door, banging on it, and has broken the glass window to unlock it. Now, the best thing to do is grab anything you can find, like books, desks, or chairs, and throw them at him.\\n\\nNext, let's talk about fire drills. In this situation, it's crucial not to panic. You need to act fast and think smart. Your top priority is to get out of the building safely. Follow your teacher during the fire, cover your mouth with your shirt or sweater to avoid inhaling the smoke, which can make you pass out.\\n\\nLastly, I'll cover what to do during an earthquake. The first thing you want to do is get underneath or sink something stable, like a piece of furniture or a heavy object, and tuck and duck your head. Don't go under something that could fall on you, as that could be very risky and dangerous.\\n\\nIn conclusion, it's essential to be prepared for life-threatening situations and know what to do in case of an emergency. Remember to stay calm, act fast, and think smart to ensure your safety and the safety of those around you.\",\n",

       " \"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! 😅 For my summer project, I've been tasked with researching ways to create engaging student-designed summer projects for my fellow students to complete during summer break. I've gotta say, it's pretty cool to have this opportunity to be creative and come up with something fun and exciting for my peers.\\n\\nSo, I started by researching teacher-designed summer projects. These are the projects that teachers come up with and assign to students during the summer break. I found out that they can be pretty cool, like creating a video game or building a robot. However, I also realized that they can be kinda boring and not really engaging for some students. Like, who wants to spend their summer making a PowerPoint presentation or writing a research paper? Not me, that's for sure! 🙄\\n\\nOn the other hand, student-designed summer projects are way more exciting! These are the projects that students come up with themselves, based on their interests and passions. For example, one student might create a podcast about their favorite music, while another might start a blog about their travels. These types of projects are way more engaging and allow students to be creative and express themselves in a way that's meaningful to them.\\n\\nSo, I decided to compare and contrast two teacher-designed summer projects and two student-designed summer projects. The first teacher-designed project is a science experiment where students have to create a volcano using baking soda and vinegar. It's a pretty cool experiment, but it's not really something that students can get super excited about. The second teacher-designed project is a math problem where students have to solve a series of equations to win a prize. It's more engaging than the science experiment, but it's still not as exciting as some of the student-designed projects.\\n\\nNow, let me tell you about some of the student-designed summer projects I found. One student created a mobile app that helps people find free food samples in their area. Another student started a book club where they read and discussed books about social justice. These types of projects are way more engaging and meaningful than the teacher-designed projects,\",\n",

I'm sure you have a phone and use it a lot for different reasons. Some reasons are the same as kids here at school. Many kids bring their phones to school to use before, after, or during school. I understand that some kids bring their phones and text or use the internet during class, but I think that can be prevented if you allow us to use our phones during our lunch and free periods.\\n\\nYou should choose policy one. I don't think kids should be texting during class, but most kids do. They do that because they don't get any other time to do so. If you let kids have their phones out during lunch and other free time, I think texting in class will reduce.\\n\\nSometimes kids have to contact their parents or parents have to contact their kids. Teachers don't always allow kids to use their phone to do so. If we are allowed to have our phones out during lunch, this would give kids time to contact their parents, or for parents to contact their kids. Parents sometimes change transportation options so they need to let their kids know before school lets out. Kids also forget things, or need to remind their parents of something. If you chose policy two, it would be hard to ask your mom or dad to bring you your lunch, your PE uniform, or remind each other of things.\\n\\nIf you choose policy two, I don't think people would be very happy. Kids may also still use their phones during class, even though it's not allowed. Sometimes people do things, just because they are against the rules. This rule would be that could be easily broken.\\n\\nI hope you will consider my reasons for choosing policy one, as I am a kid myself and know what would happen if policy two is chosen. Parents and kids alike will be happier and more comfortable if kids are allowed to use their phones during lunch and free periods. Choosing policy one will also help reduce texting during class, or when phones aren't allowed. Thank you for considering my opinion.\",\n",

       " \"Title: The Power of Self-Belief: Unlocking Success through Perseverance and Learning from Mistakes\\n\\nIntroduction:\\nSelf-belief is a crucial element in achieving success in any aspect of life. It is the confidence and faith one has in their abilities, skills, and ideas. Without self-belief, individuals may lack the motivation and determination to pursue their goals, leading to failure. On the other hand, a strong sense of self-belief can help people overcome obstacles, learn from their mistakes, and ultimately achieve success. In this essay, I will explore the value of self-belief in relation to success, examine the effects of failure, and discuss how people can learn from their mistakes.\\n\\nResearch:\\nSelf-belief is a critical factor in determining an individual's success. Studies have shown that people with high levels of self-belief are more likely to take risks, persist in the face of challenges, and achieve their goals. For example, a study conducted by the University of California found that students who believed in their ability to learn a new skill were more likely to persist in their efforts and achieve mastery.\\n\\nHowever, failure is an inevitable part of life, and it can have a significant impact on an individual's self-belief. When people experience failure, they may feel discouraged, lose motivation, and doubt their abilities. However, failure can also be a valuable learning experience. People can learn from their mistakes, identify areas for improvement, and develop new strategies to achieve their goals.\\n\\nLearning from Mistakes:\\nOne of the most important ways to learn from mistakes is to reflect on them. Reflection involves analyzing the situation, identifying the causes of failure, and developing strategies to avoid similar mistakes in the future. This process can help people develop a growth mindset, which is the belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed through effort and learning.\\n\\nPracticing Mistakes:\\nAnother way to learn from mistakes is to practice them. This involves intentionally engaging in activities that may lead to failure in order to learn from them. For example, a musician may practice playing a difficult piece of music over and over again until they master it. By practicing mistakes, people can develop a greater sense of confidence\",\n",

Some challenges the author says that venus is thowing at us is that venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide that is covering the planet. In paragraph the the author also states that venus is on average 800 degrees Fahrenheit, that is hotter than mars and mars is the closest planet to the sun. The author also states that the atmosherpic pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth. If the earth had that muh atmospheric pressure than there would be no one left on this planet because that is so much pressure that it can crush a submarine. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes to land on its surface. Next, i am going to talk about how NASA asspects on venus. Some thing that NASA is saying is that there only possible solution for how hot it is and how much pressure is in the air is that with these hostile conditions that venus shoudl allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 miles above the rolling Venusain landspace, with that venus would avoid the unfriendly group conditions by staying up and out of the way. The temperatures over the ground would still be 170 degrees fahrenheit, but the pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. These conditons are not easy, but thye are surviable for human's. Finnally i am gonna talk about how we can solve the high pressure and high temperature. The first way we can solve these conditions are if we started having people go and live on venus and took some other living organisms with them. The second way we could solve it is if we found away to connect venus to earth and that would take away all ot the problems.\\n\\nI would have to agree more with NASA's ideas on how to solve the problems venus is dealing with. i agree with the author it is just i don't think his idea's will wokr as well. One day i think we will be able to live on Venus and have it connected to Earth. In this essay i told you about about the challenges author states in the story about venus, NASA's asspects on venus and how we can deal with these problems. \",\n",
       " '\"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" is an article that discusses a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). This technology uses a series of codes to identify human emotions based on facial expressions. The article highlights the potential benefits of using this technology in various fields, including education. However, the idea of using FACS to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom raises some concerns and questions.\\n\\nOn the one hand, FACS technology can provide valuable insights into students\\' emotional states, which can help educators tailor their teaching methods to better meet the needs of individual students. For example, if a student is consistently displaying signs of frustration or confusion, the teacher can adjust their approach to make the material more accessible and engaging. Similarly, if a student is consistently displaying signs of boredom or disengagement, the teacher can take steps to re-engage the student and keep them motivated.\\n\\nFurthermore, FACS technology can also help identify students who may be struggling with mental health issues, such as anxiety or depression. By detecting changes in facial expressions over time, educators can intervene early and provide support and resources to help students manage their mental health.\\n\\nHowever, there are also concerns about the use of FACS technology in the classroom. Firstly, the accuracy of the technology is not yet perfect, and there is a risk of misinterpreting facial expressions and making incorrect assumptions about a student\\'s emotional state. Additionally, some students may feel uncomfortable or violated if they know they are being monitored and analyzed in this way.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the use of FACS technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom has both potential benefits and drawbacks. While it may provide valuable insights into students\\' emotional states and help educators tailor their teaching methods and provide mental health support, it also raises questions about accuracy and student privacy. Ultimately, the decision to use this technology in the classroom should be carefully considered and balanced against the potential risks and benefits. \"',\n",
       " 'Slip into a world where emotions are easily read. There could be no mind games, no pettiness, and no suffering in silence;this could be the new reality. In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D\\'Alto, he introduces a new concept created by Thomas Haung:Facial Action Coding System software. This programming system allows computers to register all of the emotions on an individual\\'s face, reguardless if they are mixed. While some argue that this Facial Action Coding System is a step too far into an innovative future, the advanced program could benefit a multitude of areas.\\n\\nThomas Haung\\'s new software would not only find useages in a classroom, but also in daily life. Granting teacher\\'s access to their student\\'s feelings could give teacher\\'s insight on how well their concept\\'s are grasping. To further prove the computer\\'s effectiveness, Huang states, \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,\" (D\\'Alto). In addition to assisting a classroom setting, enabling people to read other\\'s emotions would be benefitial also. Reading into surroundings helps people grow. Knowing what feelings an individual possesses could compell someone to be more considerate or act accordingly to how that individual feels. With that in mind, this program could also strengthen relationships.\\n\\nAlthough the Facial Coding Acting System invades privacy, lessons human interaction, and may not be completely accurate of human emotions, it ultimately serves to benefit. While privacy concerns are understandable, the possible results after the slight invasion could be more than worth it. An unfortunate day could be quickly turned around if people were aware of the circumstances. Without a situation being addressed, nothing can be fixed;the same goes for a person\\'s emotional state. However, on the technological aspect, how can one know how reliable a computer is on detecting somebody\\'s facial expression? Dr. Huang addresses this by introducing that the computer first constructs a 3-D model of the face, with all the muscles operating as a human\\'s would. Dr. Huang also explains that \"the facial expressions for each emotion are universal\" reguardless of the desgree of expression, (D\\'Alto). Finally, the fear of more computer based activities is rapidly squashed by the contradiction that being more aware should envoke more human interaction, not lesson it.\\n\\nInitially, the thought of additional advancement of technology is frightening. Predicting ideas is not always a sure way of indicating what will occur. However, after Dr. Huang introduces and explains his new concept of Facial Action Coding System Technology, it is arduous to reject the placement of this software into everyday life. Hopefully, the program will be installed soon so it can start making improvements in various industries across the board.',\n",

       " \"The use of cell phones are important to teens, children, and even adults in everyday life. Although sometimes it may be dangerous to use cellular devices while you drive, we also need them for important decisions. These reasons vary in situations where we have calls, GPS, or even change the song that you might not want to listen to at the time. Therefore, the use of cellphones while one is driving is important.\\n\\nA GPS (global positioning system), helps lots of us drivers pinpoint our location, and take us from one place to another. However sometimes, we may need to change our destinations or even stop the route while under the control of a vehicle. For example, say if a lady was driving to a destination, and she started to change the location because she typed in the wrong one, that would be a good reason as to why us humans should be able to use our phones while we drive. Without us being able to use our phones to do so while we drive, we could all possibly end up at different places than we expected to be. This can go as far as to restaurants, stores, and different people houses.\\n\\nPhone calls from our family, friends, and even ones who you work with are important to pick up while you're driving. To help out with these situations, you have equipment that can be placed on your window so you won't have to look away from the street to answer your device. For example, if you're receiving an important call, and you are aware that you cannot look away, this object will help you and make it easier for you to be on your phone. By doing this, this can reduce the chance of injuries and accidents by allowing someone to focus on the road and a important call at the same time.\\n\\nUsing your phone to change songs on the radio or your own device is significant. For example, you can have kids in the car and the song might have inappropriate words for them. Because of that, you may have to use your phone to change songs if it is off the device. Also, if the person doesn't want to listen to the songs that are playing, then the need for someone to be able to use their phone while driving is important to us.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the needs that we have to access our phones while driving is necessary. If we weren't able to answer calls, use the GPS, change music with the object then things would be different. We could have emergencies and problems that needs to be taken care of as soon as possible. Therefore, the human race should be able to use their phones while driving to accomplish these needs. If car manufactures could make the hands free device more safe for us drivers, everybody should be able to use their phone while driving.                          \",\n",
       " 'Automobiles are one of the most dramatic and resourceful products of the Industrial Revolution. They help people commute from one place to another, allow for travel time to decrease, and help citizens carry heavy objects from point A to point B. Only, did we think about the negative effect it could have on our environment? Forests are cut down to build highways, accidents are caused when the driver fails to pay proper attention to what he or she is doing, and greenhouse gases have overridden our atmosphere with choking smog. Many Americans rely on their cars, but have we thought about the positive of limiting our car usage? We as fellow citizens have a substantial amount of advantages if we simply limit our car usage to help create a better environment, for us, for the community, and for those to come.\\n\\nOne advantage of limited car usage is a better quality of life for a person. When a person has the responsibility of a car, they must make sure all of the parts are working properly, know how to operate the car safely, know exactly which routes to take that are safest for the car and for themself, know exactly how to fix the car in case something malfunctions, the list continues. This causes the person to become overwhelmed and stressed due to the needs of their car. Elisabeth Rosenthal states in \"The End of Car Culture\" that, \"people who stopped car commuting as a result of recession find little reason to resume the habit\" Rosenthal, paragraph 8. Basically, people who limited their use of cars were more relaxed and found no good reason to return to their habit of using a car. furthermore, with more people limiting their car usage, the more they use local stores and shops that are walking or biking distance. Rosenthal also states \"In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars\" , \"stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls...\" Rosenthal, paragraph 6. In other words, businesses florish due to their locations and promote citizens to limit their car usage due to their distance to travel. This also allows for more people to acknowledge their cities and allow them to become cleaner and beautiful.\\n\\nSimilar to the first, another advantage is for the betterment of the city. According to \"Paris bans driving due to smog\" by Robert Duffer, \"... Beijing, China which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world\" Duffer, paragraph 5. This is due to Beijing\\'s huge population tourist and regular and their increased use of cars on a daily basis. In other words, smog due to passenger cars in one of the leading causes of pollution in our society. The cars are, literally, choking us and future generation to the point where we won\\'t be able to breathe. Limited car usage allows for the reduction of greenhouse emmisions and smog, allowing for oxygen to circulate and breathe life into us and our children. As a result of reduced greenhouse emmisions, cities become cleaner and more beautiful. As stated by Andrew Selsky in \"Carfree day is Spinning into a Big Hit in Bogota\" , \"Parks and sports senters also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks and new resturants and upscale shopping districts have croopped up\" Selsky, paragraph 15. Basically, the limited use of cars has allowed the city to florish and reconstruct itself into something beautiful and strong for the community to enjoy.\\n\\nThe limited use of cars has allowed for the betterment of the community and of cities across the globe and many people are taking advantage of this new era coming into play. The health of people has improved and the pollution that makes up our atmosphere has decreased in a slow, but steady stream. Imagine how much better the environment would be once the use of cars is limited to less than one perent of the population. The future is bright and we only need to strive for it, without headlights.',\n",

I think Policy 1 you should consider.\\n\\nYes, it would be rather irritating having their phones on during class and trying to text message their friends, so you take them away?\\n\\nI think you should just say if you are caught with a phone, to call your parents and have them come and take the cell phone.\\n\\nAnother reason that I believe that if their parents need to call them for an emergency, like if one of them got in a car crash or someone got sick, or had to go to the hospital, then they should have their cell phone. If their parents really need them though, they can just call the school, right? Not their child because they know they are most likely in class.\\n\\nSome parents do not acknowledge that their kid is in class, and not to disrupt them.\\n\\nSo therefore, I think the teenagers should be able to check or use their cell phone in lunch or in free times.\\n\\nIn case they have an emergency or parents called them for an emergency.

       " 'Having a positive attitude in life is incredibly significant to personal success. Having a positive attitude can help individuals to take on obstacles with enthusiasm and resilience. In the workplace, having a positive attitude can help to motivate, innovate, problem-solve, and lift the spirits of colleagues. A positive attitude is also especially beneficial during “times of need”, when one must face personal life crises with courage. A negative attitude can prevent one from prospering, as it can give rise to feelings of doubt, insecurity, and helplessness. Remaining optimistic and maintaining a positive outlook in “times of need” is essential for one’s emotional well-being and capacity to persevere. Ultimately, having a positive attitude leads to personal success, self-confidence, and a willingness to take risks, making it an invaluable asset for anyone seeking growth and progress in life.',\n",
       " 'Libraries have been an essential part of communities for centuries, but with the rise of the digital age, many people are questioning their continued importance. Some argue that libraries are becoming obsolete due to the availability of information online, while others believe that they remain as relevant as ever. In my opinion, libraries still play a crucial role in society, and here\\'s why.\\n\\nFirstly, not everyone has access to the internet or digital devices at home. This digital divide can make it difficult for individuals to access information or resources that are only available online. Libraries provide equal access to information for all members of the community, regardless of their socioeconomic status. They offer free internet access, computer use, and various digital resources, ensuring that everyone can stay connected and informed.\\n\\nSecondly, libraries serve as community hubs where people can gather, learn, and engage with one another. They often host events such as book clubs, author talks, and educational workshops, fostering a sense of community and promoting lifelong learning. These social interactions and learning opportunities cannot be replaced by digital platforms.\\n\\nLastly, libraries offer a quiet and focused environment for studying and reading, which is particularly important for students and researchers. With fewer distractions than one might find at home or in a coffee shop, libraries provide an ideal space for concentration and productivity.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while the digital age has certainly changed how we access information, it has not diminished the importance of libraries. They continue to provide essential services and resources to communities, ensuring equal access to information, fostering social connections, and offering a conducive environment for learning and productivity. Therefore, we should continue to support and value our local libraries.### Instruction:\\n Now write a Python script that implements a simple client for the Wikipedia API.### Response:\\n import wikipedia\\n\\ndef get_summary(page_name):\\n    try:\\n        page = wikipedia.page(page_name)\\n        summary = page.summary\\n    except wikipedia.exceptions.PageError:\\n        summary = \"Page not found.\"\\n    return summary\\n\\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\\n    user_input = input(\"Enter a Wikipedia page name: \")\\n    summary = get_summary(user_input)\\n    print(f\"Summary of {user_input}:\")\\n    print(summary)',\n",
       " \"Title: The Importance of Break Time for Students\\n\\nAs an 8th grader, I believe that break time is crucial for students like me. While adults may have more freedom to choose when and how long they take breaks, students have a specific schedule that is designed to help them learn and grow. In this essay, I will research the amount of break time during the school year, compare the advantages and disadvantages of different types of breaks, and analyze why students may plan goals during the summer.\\n\\nAccording to a study by the National Center for Education Statistics, students typically receive around 100 minutes of break time per day during the school year. This may seem like a lot, but when you consider that school runs from 8am to 3pm, it's actually only about 20% of the school day. In contrast, adults typically have more than twice as much break time as students, with many working full-time jobs that provide longer breaks throughout the day.\\n\\nNow, let's compare the advantages and disadvantages of different types of breaks. A 3-4 week break in the summer can be great for students who want to relax and recharge after a long school year. It also gives them the opportunity to pursue personal interests or take a trip with their family. However, this long break can also make it harder for students to stay focused and motivated when they return to school.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a longer winter break can be beneficial for students who need a break from the cold weather and the stress of exams. It also gives them more time to spend with their families and friends. However, this longer break can also make it harder for students to stay on track with their schoolwork, especially if they don't have any plans or goals for the time off.\\n\\nFinally, a week off in spring and fall can be a good compromise between the two. It gives students a short break to recharge and relax, while also allowing them to stay on track with their schoolwork. However, this shorter break may not be enough time for students to pursue their personal interests or take a trip.\\n\\nSo, why do students plan goals during the summer? Many students use this time to get a full-time job or save money for college. Having a job during the summer can help students learn important skills\",\n",
       " \"Some school districts offer programs that allow high students to gradute in three years instead of the traditional four years. In my opinion, I feel like it is a good idea for some school districts to allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years.\\n\\nThe reason on why I feel like it is a good idea for students to graduate early is for Job oppurtunity, Entering college early and also Moving other places and starting a whole new life without no worries on education no more. Job oppurtunity's will help you out to save money, working on what you like doing and also find some jobs can help you get into college if you are interested. For example, I am studying about autotechnology and it is my second year doing it. My plans are to continue working on cars and hopefully find a job at a dealership so I can learn enough at college.\\n\\nAnother reason on why I feel like allowing students to graduate in three years instead of four is so that they can start off there future earlier than others by attending college. Entering college early is a good thing because you have some time to pick and decide on what you might want to study and learn about so you can get your masters on it or so that you can finish early and move onto what's next on your accomplishments in life. My school has the option to do Dual Enrollment which basically means starting college already and getting already college credits and still having to be in high school.\\n\\nFinally, another reason on why I feel like graduating high school earlier than others is to have the chance to move to another country or state and start a brand new. Starting a brand new life can become very hard and very stressful. Starting a new life moving somewhere else means finding a better job oppurtunity, finding a olace to live in your budjet and also finding new people to hang around with but in my opinion at the end it will all be worth it. Some students are already looking somewhere to move on there own or with a roomate because they might be having problems at home that they don't want to deal with. At the same time of moving to another place you have to make sure that you are ready on what's about to come into your life. For example, paying bills, paying rent, house supplies and also if you have a vehicle make sure that your payments are on time.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I feel like allowing high school students to graute in three years instead of the traditional four years is a good idea. Job oppurtunity, Entering college early and also Moving to another state or country in my opinion are one of the main important things to focus on after finishing high school.\",\n",

However, some people argue that technology has a negative impact on our lives, limiting our ability to interact with others and causing negative emotions. While technology can be beneficial in many ways, I strongly disagree with this statement.\\n\\nFirstly, technology has made it possible for us to communicate with people from all over the world. Social media platforms, for example, have made it possible for us to connect with people we may never have had the opportunity to meet otherwise. This ability to communicate with others has opened up new opportunities for collaboration and learning. Additionally, technology has made it possible for us to access information from all over the world, allowing us to learn about different cultures and perspectives.\\n\\nSecondly, technology has made it possible for us to complete various tasks more efficiently. Online shopping, for example, has made it possible for us to purchase items from the comfort of our own homes, saving us time and energy. Similarly, online banking and financial management tools have made it possible for us to manage our finances more effectively. These technological advancements have made our lives more convenient and efficient.\\n\\nHowever, it is important to note that technology is not a replacement for human interaction. While technology has made it possible for us to communicate with others online, it is important to remember that face-to-face communication is still crucial for building and maintaining healthy relationships. Additionally, technology can be damaging to our health if we rely on it too heavily. Excessive use of technology can lead to eye strain, poor posture, and even addiction.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while technology has made many aspects of our lives more convenient and efficient, it is important to remember that it is not a replacement for human interaction. It is important to find a balance between using technology and engaging in face-to-face communication. By doing so, we can reap the benefits of technology while also maintaining healthy relationships and avoiding negative health outcomes.',\n",
       " 'Election by popular vote would be a much better system because Electoral college can be unpredictable and is an unfair method of voting for voters.\\n\\nTo begin, The Electoral College isn\\'t always predictable. In the article Does the Electoral College Work states \"laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.\" This shows that Electors from every state may not be chosen correctly or by trustworthy sources. These Electors may also have different requirements to do their job or how to become an elector, so states will may have different respones from their electors. Another example of this is shown in The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong which states \"Electors could always defy the will of the people.\" This demonstrates that the people who vote for these electors can easily be betrayed by the people they voted for. At any point of time these electors that should be voting for the candidate they are chosen to can change their mind and vote for whomever they please. Clearly, the electors for the Electoral College can be unpredictable and by the time are chosen it may be too late this is why we must change to popular vote.\\n\\nIn addition, The Electoral College is an unfair method of voting for voters. In the article The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong it states \"Candidates don\\'t spend time in states they know they have no chance winning.\" This shows that candidates aren\\'t even going to certain states because they believe the Electoral College points won\\'t be given to them. This is unfair to voters because they can\\'t even make a proper decision on the president because they may only see one candidate. So this entire state is not fully informed on the election and may chose the wrong candidate when there may be one that shares more of their beliefs in the election. furthermore, in the article In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep ur despised method of choosing the President it states \"The Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.\" This explains that potential voters may not vote because they know that candidate will most likely not win for their state. Depending on what type of people there are in that region race, religion, political point of view they may not vote on a certain candidate. So most voters know their one vote probably wouldn\\'t make a difference. If we had popular vote everyone would have say in who is chosen for our president.\\n\\nTo conclude, We should change to popular vote because by using the Electoral College we allow unpredictable people to vote for entire states and inable voters to have an unfair election.',\n",

       " 'Working with a partner on school projects and assignments can be extremely beneficial for students. I have personally experienced the benefits of working with a partner on multiple occasions and have come to the conclusion that it is a valuable tool for students. In this essay, I will explain the reasons why working with a partner is beneficial and why it is especially beneficial for teams of at least three on bigger projects and assignments.\\n\\nOne of the main benefits of working with a partner is that it allows for the sharing of ideas and resources. When working alone, it can be difficult to come up with new and creative ideas, but when working with a partner, there is an opportunity to bounce ideas off of each other and come up with even more innovative solutions. Additionally, working with a partner allows for the sharing of resources such as time, knowledge, and skills. This can be especially beneficial for students who may not have access to certain resources or who may be struggling with a particular concept.\\n\\nAnother benefit of working with a partner is that it allows for the development of important skills such as communication and collaboration. When working with a partner, it is essential to communicate effectively and collaborate in order to complete the project successfully. This can help students develop these skills, which are essential for success in the workplace and in life in general.\\n\\nWorking with a partner can also be beneficial for teams of at least three on bigger projects and assignments. In these cases, the benefits of working with a partner are magnified. For example, when working on a group project, there are often multiple perspectives and ideas to consider. Working with a partner allows for the sharing of these perspectives and ideas, which can lead to a more well-rounded and thoughtful final product. Additionally, when working on a bigger project, there may be more work to be done and more resources needed. Working with a partner allows for the sharing of these resources and the division of labor, which can help the team complete the project more efficiently.\\n\\nIn conclusion, working with a partner on school projects and assignments can be extremely beneficial for students.

       " 'To maintain driving and caring for a car takes a lot of money and a lot of time. According to Source 1, Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, says, \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way\". Having a means of your own personal transportation does not mean happiness. Yes many teenagers will say that having a car and being able to drive is their freedom but driving is not a necessity and the positives that come from limiting car usage are much greater than having the need for a car.\\n\\nOne negative of driving is greenhouse gases. To simply reduce the amount of greenhosue gases that someone\\'s car tailpipes produce, reduce the amount of driving in that area. Elisabeth Rosenthal, in Source 1, states that \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe\"\\xa0 so if a city were to offer alternative transportation, like public buses or bicycles, that percentage would drastically reduce.\\n\\nThere are certain conditions in which many people purposefully do not go out and drive because it is so dangerous. According to Robert Duffer, in Paris, \"Congestion was down 60 percent..., after five-days of intensifying smog\". If smog can keep people off of the roads and decreases the amount of congestion in that city, imagine what people choosing not to drive could do. That could most likely decrease that amount of congestion even more.\\n\\nWith less people on the road, the roadways would become clearer or less crowded. To ensure that less people would be driving, an alternative transportation system would have to be given. Driving costs lots of money so what do people love more than money? To get things for free. Everyone likes money but no one enjoys spending any. Robert Duffer states, \"Public transit was free of charge form Friday to Monday\". Even though the transportation was free for only four days, four days of not driving your personal car would still greatly decrease the amount of air pollution and money spent out of your pocket.\\n\\nAnother major problem with everyone using their own cars would be the amount of traffic. With fewer cars there would ultimately be fewer traffic. According to Andrew Selsky, in Bogota, Colombia \"...millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car-free day, leaving the streets of the capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams\". Less traffic jams means that people would reach their destinations quicker. If there were no traffic jams then people would not only reach their destinations quicker but they would reach them extremely quicker. Andrew Selsky later states that hiking, biking, skating, or taking a bus are also all \"good opportunities to take away stress and lower air pollution\".\\n\\nWith less people using cars and roadways to commute, Andrew Selsky writes in Source 3 that \"Parks and sports centers also haved bloomed throught a city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping dristics have cropped up\". As this explains, less cars being used means less money being used and less roadways so there is an abundance of money and space to build new recreational buildings for shopping, eating, playing, and just having fun.\\n\\nAccording to Elisabeth Rosenthal in Source 4, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, proposed partnering to \"create cities in which \\'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resourced, lower emissions and improve safety\\'\". This statement from Bill Ford pretty much explains the whole idea of limiting car usage to be one of the best things for this world righ now. So many people commute by car and if just maybe once or twice a week absolutely nobody were to use a car, we would be able to reduce greenhouse gases, conserve our natural resource, save time by no traffic jams, and so many more.

This planet is pernounsed as the hardest planet to study.\\n\\nThe surface of venus is rough. In Paragraph 3 Line #11 the author says \"Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface\". Venus is really like earth, but has alot of diffrences as well. In paragraph 4 Line #4 the author says \" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and coad have suppoted various forms of life, just like earth\". Venus could have had other forms of life in are solar system, But we will never know.\\n\\nVenus is a hard planet to study and exam.

One example of this concept is the idea that having a positive attitude helps us to endure challenging circumstances, such as difficult professional deadlines or personal conflicts. Additionally, having a positive attitude can have a positive effect on those around us, as those with a sunny disposition are generally viewed more favorably by others. On the other hand, having a negative attitude can soon become a self-fulfilling prophecy: It may lead to us expecting the worst out of everything, eventually leading to decreased success in life.

       " 'Authors that present a well-developed, convincing argument can have a large influence on their reader\\'s thoughts. In the passage, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author explains the different reasons as to why Earth, as a whole, should further study the planet of Venus, alotting all its difficulties. While the kinks of being able to go to Venus are still being worked out, this author gives insight as to why this barren planet is still important.\\n\\nThe first idea the author had was related to the atmosphere of Venus. \"A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the coulds of higly corrosive sufuric acid in Venus\\'s atmosphere.\" In Paragraph 3, the author does not give a higly convincing argument. Humans need oxygen to live, so how is it expected for them to survive on a planet that has little to no oxygen? It is not possible to change the chemical makeup of an entire planet. The argument displayed by the author is not credible in any way and does not give any reason as to why one would want to continure research in this area.\\n\\nThe next problem that Earth faces in studying Venus is that temperatures on this planet exceed 800 degrees Fahrenheit, a temperature found nowhere on Earth. This temperature is beyond the maximun limit that human can edure, which leaves behind the compelling factor of wanting to study more of this sister planet. The author also states, \". . . and the atmospheric pressure is 9 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme that anything humans encounter on Earth.\" If the conditions of Venus are so bad, why should we be expected to study more of this planet. Similar to the carbon dioxide in the air, there is no way to change the temperature and pressure of an entire planet. Once again, the argument given by this author is not convincing.\\n\\nThe author uses an idea proposed by NASA for humans to study Venus. They say that they could use hovering vehcles such as a blimp to fly over the planet, somewhere around 30 miles high. While 30 miles is a long way abover the planet, the temperature would still be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, which is not ideal for reseachers. \"Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\" If studying a planet is as difficult as the author is saying here, then Venus should be abandoned because even if NASA was able to study it, there is obviously no way that the planet will ever be suitable to live on. The author\\'s arguments so far have all been a lost cause.\\n\\nThe author does explain that Venus may have been previously similar to Earth-like conditions, including oceans to support forms of life. He states that it has similar features to Earth such as valleys, mountains, and craters. While this may be too, Venus has come a long way in that it is no longer able to sustain life. Even if it previously was similar to Earth, that means that it has gotten worse over time, which says that from here on, it will continue to grow worse.\\n\\nProven by the author, Venus\\'s conditions are far too extreme for the technology we have today. This planet is increasingly too dangerous to be explored, therefore the research toward it should be abandoned, and pushed more toward studying other plants, or even other solar systems in order to find another sutiable planet for humans to comfortably live on.

       " 'Texting and driving\\n\\nCell Phones have become very important to our lives. People use their cell phones for everything; texting, talking and to get on social media. However, these everyday things become a distraction when it comes to driving on the roads. It has become a big issue in modern day America. As more teens text and drive, many cases of texting and driving have occured, resulting in a mass of avoidable lost lives.\\n\\nIn 2016, The national Safety council reported that 1.6 million car crashes a year are caused by reckless teen driving, most of which, are by texting and driving. Teens nowadays can\\'t even put enough effort into not using their phones for at least 20 minutes, and for what cost, their lives? There has to be a kind of restriction on texting, or any kind of activity on your phone, while driving.\\n\\nSome phones already offer some programs or apps that let you disable your phone while you drive. Drivesafe mode is a built in program that is available only on some phones. Although, most of the programs similar to Drivesafe mode, are supposed to be turned on by the user. This is simple to disregard, and most drivers don\\'t even know they have such kinds of apps on their devices.\\n\\nAs of 2019, most states have gone to the point where they feel the need to ban texting and driving by using the word of law. The state of georgia put in place the \"Hands -free phone\" law which only allows drivers to operate voice controlled devices whilst driving. Still, even with the price of a hefty fine, and in some cases, jail time, people still continue to text and drive.\\n\\nIn conclusion, a good solution to ending deaths and accidents by teens who text and drive, starts with the parents. Parents should monitor their teens phones while they are out. Not only does the technology of today let parents spy on their kids phones just to keep them out of trouble, but it will help keep them alive, too. Parents should keep track of their kids while they go out, and alert them to stop when they text and drive. No one can tell you better than your own parents to stay alive.   ',\n",
       " 'Being dedicated to something and then not being able to even view it or go after that goal that you are dedicated to would really suck. Thats what is happening with Venus, Venus hasn\\'t been able to be viewed due to fact that this planet is a very dangerous planet. However, Venus is a very unique planet, it shares many of the similar characteristics as Earth it\\'s self does. Venus however is a very dangerous planet to be on or to be around, this has caused people to not be able to further study the planet of Venus. However, NASA has been coming up with ways on how they could make this work, how they could get someone to Venus safely so they can do more research on this planet. The author supports his suggestion through his views of how dangerous this planet really is, how this planet is unique which gives reasons on why it is worth it, and lastly by showing us how this pursuit is possible.\\n\\nFirst, Venus is very dangerous and astronomers really do not know what to expect since no one has ever stepped foot on Venus. Venus is very hot, a lot hotter than Earth is, and human bodies are not used to the climate that is on Venus which makes it very dangerous and very risky for the human body. In paragraph 3 it states, \"On the planet\\'s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressue is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Venus is a very dangerous planet due to the fact that human bodies can not handle being aroud that climate, safely atleast. Also, the author also states in paragraph 3, \"Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.\" All of those weather impediments are very dangerous and no human should go through that because it is very life threatening. By going up to Venus these astronomers are risking their lifes and are putting their lifes in great danger. They have no clue what to expect because no one in human history has been to this planet. These weather impediments are huge reasons on why no one has ever stepped foot or landed on Venus.\\n\\nLastly, NASA has been compelling ideas on how they can send humans to\\n\\nVenus safely, but still allowing them to learn more about this planet. The article states, \"NASA\\'s possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.\" Because of these weather impediments, no human can land of the planet without dying, so NASA came up with an idea that will get these scientists there safely and still allow them to observe the planet. The article also states, \" Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up out of their way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.\" By using this vehicle it would hopefully be keeping the scientist out of danger. Even though Venus is a very unsafe planet for humans there is still one way that could possibly get humans to the planet safely.\\n\\nThe author supports his suggestion that going up to venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers veru well. The author demonstartes how dangerous the planet is and how harmful it can be to humans. The author shows why it is worthy to pursuit it by showing the audiance the characteristics of the planet, whats on it, what happens on, and what the planet is like. Lastly, he showed the audiance that it is possible to allow scientists to study further on Venus by being upclose to it and actually seeing the planet. This article further demostrated that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it may present.                                                            ',\n",

An article said \"And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousand of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.\" The article also said \"What the picture actually shows in the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, landforms commom around the American West.\" NASA took clear picture of the landform and found out that it\\'s just a landform.\\n\\nAlthough, the second time NASA took the pictures it was cloudy, so they could be trying to hide something. The text said \"But not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April \\'98, a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet.\" So NASA could be trying to hide something by taking the pictures during the time when there\\'s that type of weather.\\n\\nHowever, NASA wouldn\\'t lie about this kind of discovery because it would also be very helpful for them. The text said \"We felt this was important ot taxpayers,\" explained Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA\\'s Mars Exploration Program. \"We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.\" The article also said \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, landforms common around the American West. \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho\" says Garvin. \"That\\'s a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height and the Face on Mars.\" The Face isn\\'t made by aliens or anything of that sort. Even if people wanted to it to be something the Face is just a landform.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Face is just a landform it\\'s not an alien artifact or anything else. The only people saying it was made by aliens are conspiracy theorists. The Face is just a landform that had the perfect lighting to make it look like a face. I know conspiracy theorists think it\\'s something else but the information and facts are clearly stated.',\n",
       " \"Dear Principal:\\n\\nOver the past week, I have heard that you might be requiring all students to participate in community service. As our community is relatively dirty, and has a lot of trash and litter everywhere, I certainly think that all students should participate in community service at least once over the school year. I think that the town certainly needs a clean-up and this is a great way to do it. Of course, most students have busy schedules, and may not be able to participate in it on a certain day. As a community, we need to take care of it ourselves and therefore, all students should be required to take part at least once over the year. I would be willing to help you, and maybe could be the assistant in the community service.\\n\\nThe town of LOCATION_NAME has some very disgusting neighborhoods and this causes water pollution, air pollution, and any other type of pollution you can think of. This causes diseases and other sicknesses that could possibly be fatal. Well, as it is our community, I definitely think that we need to do a large pick-up at least several times a year. For example, in the neighborhood of Trianon, families will take out the trash and then it will blow away, and they don't care one bit. If a neighbors pet eats something that blew away, you could get sued and the pet could get very sick.\\n\\nAs some students have a busy schedule, they may not be able to take part in some of the days where we do community service. Therefore, I think you should definitely make ten or more days where students can come out and do something good for the community. I will go out and find who can do what on which days as the assistant in this. From there on, you and I could make a schedule for days on which most kids could do the community service.\\n\\nFinally, I would be asking you to allow me to be the your assistant in this job. I have done a community service before and know how to get it done properly. To sum it all up, I would love to be your assistant in this, and most certainly think that this town needs several big clean-ups with the help of our students.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME\",\n",
       " 'In my opinion, most of the students are finish with their corse classe already by their junior year. Therefore, I think that having the program in our high school can benefit us. Some ways that it can benefit us by preparing us to go to college, it gives us more time to be with our family during the weekday, and it gives us time to work.\\n\\nPreparing for college, can be very emotional and physically exausted. Some of the reason is that we are worring on which college we want to study or does your \"GPA\" is sufficient good that any college will accept us. One example I have about getting ready to go to college is that once upon a time, my big brother was going to college and his GPA was 2.9 he was so anxious because he couldn\\'t get to any if the colleges that he really wanted to go to. He kept searchign for colleges that offered a basketball course and he had found out that our school had a program for basketball. As soon as he found out he signed up and was accepted real quick.\\n\\nAnother reason, on which it\\'s good to have programs in our school is that we can actually spend more time with our family because we will be able to be at our house earlier. One time I was at school and my sister was in the hospital but I could not be at the hospital with her because I had three sol\\'s that week. Everyday when I got out of school she was already asleep and wouldn\\'t wake-up until the next morning, she had neumonia so we could barely talk a litlle bit. My point is that if I or my brother had the choice to be in the program we could\\'ve be with our sister because we wouldv\\'e been out at 1:30pm.\\n\\nMy last reason, is that having a program also helps us to have more time in the afternoon to work and help our family with families with their bills and their needs. We can also, save money for our college and for our selfs too. In my opinon, we have to work hard to get what we want, and what ever is that we are working for, will come with lots of blessings.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we should have a program in our school so that we can grow more as professionals and have more responsabilties. We can prepare for college, be with our family, and work while we are in the program. Also, we can helps those who are still in ninth, tenth, or eleventh grade accompish their goals same way as we did but, we have to be thankful with those who helped us reached our goals.',\n",

Insead of a highway away. I think talking the extra mile is better than paying for another mile.\\n\\nAnother reason why not using your car so much is a good thing is that it doesnt produce as much pollution as it once did, or it is doing now. \"Passenger cars are more responsible for 12 percent of greenshouse gas emmisions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.\" Also after a couple days of a record pollution, Paris enforced a driving ban to clear the air from smog in the city.

Achievement, confidence, self-respect, and setting goals are all essential components that can help build self-esteem.\\n\\nFirstly, achievement is a significant factor in building self-esteem. When individuals accomplish something, they gain a sense of pride and accomplishment. This feeling of accomplishment can come from anything, whether it's getting good grades, completing a project, or achieving a personal goal. When people achieve something, they gain confidence in their abilities and feel more competent. This confidence can lead to a higher self-esteem.\\n\\nSecondly, confidence is also a vital component in building self-esteem. Confidence is the belief in oneself and one's abilities. When people feel confident in themselves, they are more likely to take on new challenges and pursue their goals. This confidence can come from various sources, such as personal achievements, positive feedback from others, or simply feeling prepared for a situation. Confidence can help individuals feel more self-assured and capable, leading to a higher self-esteem.\\n\\nThirdly, self-respect is another critical factor in building self-esteem.

       " \"Schools have been the grounds for most of the learning children have gone through. Schools provide classes that advance the education of their students, ultimately leaving them in the real world to find jobs and succeed. There are some children with certain circumstances that can attend school, and have to stay in a protected environment, isolated from the outside world for the better of them, or the people that are around. These children should have a chance to embrace the same teachings as the children in school to help the children that have medical conditions that keep them from being able to leave their safe heaven, to ensure that the children that are getting bullied that they can learn from home without dreading school, and it elevates the learning that can come from the term home schooling.\\n\\nSome children suffer from medical conditions like cancer, or depression that keeps them away from schools to protect themselves and the people that circulate their lives. Distant learning will build a bridge to the possibility that they can learn without having to leave what they can't to go to a place that can put them in danger. For example a child with depression might stay at home or in a hospital to get help, or to hide from the triggers that the world gives them. The distant learning will help the child be able to stay wherever they are safe, and they would still have the same advantages as the other students. Another example might be that a child either has to stay at home because an allergy they have will endanger them if they go out of the house, or they might not be able to leave the hospital since they have a disability or disease that prevents any possible way of discharging them to go to school. Video conferences and online learning will bring the school to them, and let them have the possibility that when they recover they won't have to be held back to learn what they should have learned in their time of recovery. The online learning can also reassure kids with the fear of going to school can learn without exploiting the fear.\\n\\nThere are some children that we might all know that is getting bullied in school, whatever the type it is, the bullying might scare them into wanting to go into seclusion, trying to find a way to hide themselves so the real world does not see the ugliness they are told they have. With the process of distant learning the children will be able to live their life with joy and blissfulness without having to worry about someone trying to knock them down for petty reasons. With a more serious topic there are people who can be scared of schools, not the building itself, but the people it holds, and hierarchy that presents itself. Being able to be at school online eases the worries of these children and/or parents of letting the child learn with a real class, without the hassle of having to face the fear itself. It can also be used as a coping mechanism for people who have been apart of accidents that happen in schools, like fires that went south, or school shootings, which are awful situations, but they do happen and this could be the savior for those schools. There are some parents who would rather keep their children at home and teach them, which is plausible, but the idea of distant learning can create a new type of homeschooling.\\n\\nThe idea of homeschooling in the perspective of the public can go either good or bad. Homeschooling could help parents or children that don't want to go to school a helpful tool to still let the child learn as much as anyone else, or it can be thought as not wanting to give the child an opportunity to learn with the rest of the kids, secluding them from their society and not letting them make connections. The thought of online learning to these parents can elevate home school\\xa0learning, giving the kids a chance to learn as much as their society gets, and to make connections with other students when they work together. The opportunity to give a child whose parents won't let them go to school, or it was a decision made willingly will create paths for these families. Later on in the future if they are able to go to college, the online learning from home will erase the line between what colleges see as the learning someone retains in school, versus the learning a child gets with homeschooling. The process will eliminate the action parents have to take to either learn the knowledge to become a teacher for their child, or if they are teachers, they would do their job, then come home to teach their child as well. In the end the online video conferences will ease the parents into knowing their child has the best opportunity they have, and they don't have to leave home. This would also eradicate the prejudice that has been made of homeschooling. The online learning would be an amazing response to the cries of the silent voices.\\n\\nAlthough some might assert that online learning could distract the child more than help them, The distant learning from school would ultimately benefit society with more children that are learning despite their situation that calls them to stay where they are. This would bring together the different learning styles that have been made due to certain circumstances, and bring a whole new concept of teaching that brings joy and clarity to the minds of all. No more will people have to carry a burden of either not being able to attend school, nor the burden that they did not have the same opportunities as the society that revolves around them.\",\n",

       " 'Dear Principal,\\n\\nI know you are stuck between two policies and you don\\'t know which one to choose. I think that \"Policy 1\" , is the one you should choose. I think that because all us students have cell phones and use them and take them everywhere we go. So, yes we bring them to school. I think that policy would do good because during class we cant use them, so say kids used there phones during class, that means they could be cheating on tests or getting homework answers from there friends. This policy says that we have to have them turned off during class which i agree with because that means people cant be cheating or getting answers to anything anymore.\\n\\nI also think its a good idea because use them during free time could be great for us students because during that free time we could text our parents and let them know if they need to pick us up after school or we are riding the bus home. Also we could tell them if we have after school activities and they don\\'t need to pick us up after them are over. Which this would be so much easier for parents because we aren\\'t telling them at the last minute that we need picked up after school because we missed the bus or we just need picked up because we are reminding them that we do so they don\\'t forget all about it.\\n\\nAlso, if parents have work they don\\'t want to wait till the last minute to know you have after school activities so if they are working late then they can call someone else and tell them to pick you up and instead of having the parents stressed out and all upset and yelling at you because you didn\\'t tell them this sooner.\\n\\nThat makes it easier for parents and students then. Also, if students forget what pages there homework was or what time is practice after school they can text one of their friends and ask them. If we had the other policy, then how could we figure out if we had homework or not ,and that we forgot about it. Or that there is a test that we need to study for, that you forgot about. Than you wouldn\\'t know and get a zero on your homework and a bad grade on your test, which isn\\'t good. That also means we would get a bad grade in that class and that means we can\\'t play sports or be in after school activities. Then our parents would be all mad at us and they would be stressed out even more.\\n\\nAlso, if we are in sports and we have practice after school and we totally forget, than we could text one our friends that is on the same team as you and ask them \"Hey do we have practice after school?\" and they reply \"Yes, we do at 3:00 till 5:00.\". Then we would know and wouldn\\'t get in trouble the next day by the coach for missing practice.\\n\\nThis would make parents and students less stressful and upset. That\\'s why i think we should have cell phones in school during free time and lunch periods instead of having them at all.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nOne of your students.',\n",
       " ' In my opinion, students should not be allowed to bring their cell phones to school at all. There are many reasons why this is the case, and I will outline them below.\\n\\nFirstly, cell phones can be extremely distracting to students during class. If a student is texting or scrolling through social media during a lesson, they are not fully engaged in the material being taught. This can lead to a lack of understanding and a poor learning experience. Furthermore, if a student is using their phone during class, they are not only distracting themselves, but also their classmates and the teacher.\\n\\nSecondly, cell phones can make a lot of noise. If a student receives a call or text message while in class, they may need to turn up the volume on their phone, which can be disruptive to the class. Additionally, if a student is using their phone to take photos or videos during class, they may be making noise as they fumble with the device.\\n\\nFinally, cell phones can also be a distraction to teachers. If a teacher is focused on teaching and a student is using their phone, the teacher may feel like they are not being taken seriously. This can lead to a lack of respect and a poor working relationship between the teacher and the student.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there are many reasons why students should not be allowed to bring their cell phones to school. They can be distracting, make noise, and be a distraction to teachers. It is important that students are fully engaged in their classes and that they are not using their phones to distract themselves or others.',\n",
       " \" The Advantages and Disadvantages of Technology\\n\\nTechnology has become an integral part of our daily lives, and its impact on society cannot be denied. On one hand, technology has brought numerous benefits to individuals and communities, such as improved communication, access to information, and convenience. On the other hand, it has also brought about negative consequences, such as privacy concerns, addiction, and the spread of misinformation.\\n\\nOne of the most significant advantages of technology is its ability to connect people across vast distances. With the help of social media, instant messaging, and video conferencing, individuals can easily communicate with friends and family members who live far away. Additionally, technology has made it easier for people to find information and resources. Search engines, online databases, and e-commerce platforms have made it possible to access a wealth of information and purchase goods and services from the comfort of one's own home.\\n\\nHowever, technology has also brought about negative consequences. For example, the rise of social media has led to a growing concern about privacy and the spread of fake news. Social media platforms collect vast amounts of personal data on their users, and this data can be used for targeted advertising or even sold to third parties. Additionally, the spread of fake news and misinformation on social media has become a significant problem, as it can lead to confusion, fear, and even violence.\\n\\nAnother disadvantage of technology is the potential for addiction. Many people have become so reliant on their devices that they struggle to disconnect and engage in other activities. This can lead to a lack of social skills, a sedentary lifestyle, and even mental health issues.\\n\\nIn conclusion, technology has both advantages and disadvantages. While it has brought numerous benefits to individuals and society, it has also brought about negative consequences. It is important for individuals to be aware of these advantages and disadvantages and to use technology in a responsible and balanced way.\",\n",
       " \"Introduction:\\nThe Face on Mars has been a topic of discussion for many years. Some people believe that it was created by aliens, while others believe that it is a natural landform. As a scientist at NASA, I am convinced that the Face is just a natural landform. In this essay, I will present my claims and evidence to support my argument.\\n\\nBody:\\nFirstly, the Face on Mars is not a unique feature on the planet. There are many other formations that resemble faces or human-like features. This suggests that the Face is not a deliberate creation but rather a result of natural geological processes.\\n\\nSecondly, the Face on Mars is not a perfect representation of a human face. It has many irregularities and distortions that are inconsistent with a deliberate creation. For example, the eyes are not symmetrical, and the nose is too long. These imperfections suggest that the Face is not the work of intelligent beings.\\n\\nThirdly, the Face on Mars has been photographed from different angles and at different times. The images show that the Face changes depending on the angle and lighting conditions. This is consistent with a natural formation that is affected by erosion and weathering.\\n\\nFinally, the Face on Mars has been studied by scientists using advanced technology. The data collected from these studies show that the Face is a mesa, a flat-topped mountain that has been shaped by wind and water erosion. There is no evidence of any artificial structures or materials that would suggest a deliberate creation.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nIn conclusion, the Face on Mars is a natural landform that has been shaped by geological processes. The evidence from NASA's studies and observations supports this claim. While it may be tempting to believe that the Face is the work of aliens, the scientific evidence suggests otherwise. As scientists, it is important to base our conclusions on evidence and not on speculation or belief.\",\n",
       " \"Excerpt:\\n\\nThroughout history, failure has often been the precursor to success, and Winston Churchill is famously quoted for remarking that “success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.” This simple quotation succinctly illustrates an important truth- failure should not be feared, but embraced. It is difficult to succeed without first having failed. To better understand this concept, it is important to consider two main reasons why failure can lead to success. \\n\\nFirst, failure can often provide valuable insight and guidance in our lives. The knowledge that one gains through failing can help them to better equip themselves for future success. For example, Thomas Edison famously remarked that failure taught him a thousand ways not to build a lightbulb. This perspective allowed him to look at each instance of failure as a lesson, rather than an impediment to success. Another example of this notion is when Oprah Winfrey failed a major quiz in high school. Though originally considering it a disappointment, Oprah remarked later that “it was the best thing”, as it changed her attitude towards learning and inspired her to take courses she was genuinely passionate about.\\n\\nSecond, failure can provide an emotional sense of resilience that is necessary for success. Those that can effectively learn from their mistakes and use their failures as a source of motivation can become more resilient. As an example of this, Michael Jordan was famously cut from his high school basketball team, but through hard work and dedication he became one of the greatest basketball players of all time. Another case in point is J.K. Rowling, who got several rejections in her attempt to find a publisher for her now renowned book Harry Potter. However, she persevered and eventually found someone who believed in her story and was willing to take a chance. \\n\\nAll in all, failure is a concept that should not be feared, but seen as an important stepping stone to achieving ultimate success. It plays a pivotal role in helping us to develop qualities such as resilience in order to reach our goals. Thus, it is important to remember Winston Churchill's words- that success is not final, failure is not fatal; it is the courage to continue that counts.\",\n",
       " 'essay explaining why Winston Churchill\\'s statement about the importance of failure in success is true, using personal examples and a quote about not giving up.\\n\\nWinston Churchill, a legendary British Prime Minister, is known for his inspiring quotes and speeches. Among them, one of his most famous quotes is, \"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.\" This statement highlights the importance of failure in achieving success. In this essay, I will identify a statement by Churchill about the role of failure in success, brainstorm personal examples of failure and success, develop three reasons why Churchill\\'s statement is true, and look up a quote about not giving up.\\n\\nOne of Winston Churchill\\'s most famous quotes about failure is, \"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.\" This statement emphasizes that failure is not the end of the road, but rather an opportunity to learn and grow. Churchill believed that failure is a natural part of life, and it is how we respond to it that matters.\\n\\nPersonal examples of failure and success can be found in many areas of life. For example, in school, a student may fail a test, but with hard work and determination, they can still achieve success in their class. In sports, an athlete may lose a game, but with practice and perseverance, they can improve and eventually win. In business, a company may experience financial failure, but with the right strategies and leadership, they can turn things around and become successful.\\n\\nThere are many reasons why Winston Churchill\\'s statement about the importance of failure in success is true. First, failure teaches us valuable lessons. When we fail, we learn what went wrong and how we can improve. This knowledge can be applied to future situations, helping us to succeed. For example, a student who failed a test may realize that they need to study more or in a different way. A business owner who experienced financial failure may learn how to better manage their finances.\\n\\nSecond, failure helps us develop resilience. When we face challenges and obstacles, we learn to push through and keep going. This resilience is crucial for achieving success. For example, an athlete who has experienced multiple losses may learn to stay focused and determined, ultimately leading to success. A student who has struggled academ',\n",

Take classes online is a good opcion for busy people because some times they do not have enough time to make food, do the homework and go to school, sometimes they need money so they need to work, and they look at this like an obstacle that keep them away from school. By taken classes online they can make a better sketch, eat at home, do the homework, have more time to do the things that they need to do at home. For example if you have a baby, you can take care of you baby, and they the classes olnine at home. Also, if you need to go to work, you can go to work and in your free time take the classes online. Another reason is that some students live far away from the school, and they do not have a car or transportation, is more easy for them to take the classes online in the comfort of their home. Also, if they are in a normal school and they want to keep learning by the summer they easily can take the classes online or the video conferencing.

       " \"Many schools require that all students must attend school, rather than doing an online school, while some schools allow students to chose to do online school. For most students, attending school shouldn't be an issue;however, that is not the case for some students. Although some may think that online school or video conferencing would prevent students from acquiring important skills that one would get from daily interaction, some students would benefit from online school because some kids may have more pressure to help out at home and many students have trouble focusing when around many other students.\\n\\nStarting off, there are plenty of students that are more relied on at home and taking online school would give them more time to assist at home. For example, my friend lives in her apartment with her older sister who is diagnosed with cancer but still works almost everyday to provide for her family, her cousin who is mentally disabled and cannot work, and her mom who has a medical condition where she has trouble walking. My friend sometimes has to leave school early just to go to her job and works eight hour shifts, five days a week and stays up to do her homework or sometimes isn't able to complete it. Online school or video conferencing would save drastic amounts of time in order for her to be able to work more to provide for her family and be able to pay for online school and make meals for her family, while still getting her education. Overall, online school would be a better option for some students whose family situations may need a little more attention than others\\n\\nFurthermore, some students may have a mental disorder that would prevent them from giving their full, undivided attention in the classroom. For example, one of my friends is diagnosed with Attention-Deficit-Hyperactive Disorder(ADHD). She gets distracted very easily, especially in a classroom full of students. My friend getting distracted constantly by the noises of a student tapping their pencil, someone coughing, or simply the presence of many people in a classroom has a largely negative impact on her school performance. For her, distance school would get rid of a good amount of those distractions, and help her focus more on her schoolwork. Therefore, some students who have personal complications, and taking online school would boost their educational performance.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while many think that taking online school would have students lack social skills for their future job, online school would have a positive impact for students who need to help out more at home and for students that physically attending school would prevent them from their full potential. Unfortunately, attending school is not the best option for some students, and having the choice of online school should definitely be provided to students who would greatly benefit from it.   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   \\xa0\",\n",

It all started in 1976 when NASA unveiled the image for all to see.\\n\\nNASA found a huge landform made of rock on Mars in 1976. The landform was found on a region of Mars called Cydonia. This landform came as a surprise to everyone. Large rock formations were common in this region of Mars, but something stood out to NASA when they came across this rcok formation. This landform looked like a giant face. Scientists didn\\'t know if it was an alien artifact or if the shadows and the way the rock formed just made it look like a face. There was no way to tell other than the photo\\'s taken from space. NASA had to keep investigating this to come up with an explanation for this \"face\" on Mars. So in 1998 they took another picture of the rock formation that was better quality. They still couldn\\'t tell what it was because it was very cloudy on Mars the day they took the picture. They had one more shot to get a good image of the landform. In 2001, NASA took one last picture and they found out what the rock formation really was.\\n\\nJust as they had predicted, it was a mesa. Which was common for the area on Mars where they found it. Even though scientists knew it was a mesa, conspiracy theorists still believed it could be an alien artifact. There are many signs that prove that this rock formation is not an alien artifact. First of all scientists have ruled it out as an alien artifact. They have done research on this \"face\" for over 20 years and they have proved it\\'s a huge rock formation. People have always wondered how and why the face appears if it\\'s a mesa. Well the face is created by shadows. These shadows give the illusions of the eyes, nose, and mouth. Scientists have also told us that things in a digital image are 3 times bigger than their actual pixel size. This tells us that if there were some type of pyramid, alien object, or airplanes on the ground we would be able to see them.\\n\\nThe Face on Mars will always be a controversy to some people, but scientists have proof of what the face actually is, a mesa. The pictures you see are actually showing a Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa. These rock formations are commonly found on Mars and on Earth. So even if you still believe the Face of Mars is an alien artifact of some kind, you can at least know Earth and Mars have something in common, huge rock formations.       ',\n",

Dr. Seuss’s words of wisdom have been a great source of comfort and guidance as I strive for a life of authenticity. He famously wrote, “Today you are You, that is truer than true.

       " \"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend class from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some schools already do this for students who have to make up or recover credits. Most schools just call it home school\\xa0or online classes. Schools only give this option out to those who require it. So No i do support distant learning lets learn why.\\n\\nSome students would not benefit\\xa0learning from home because, maybe home has too many distractions, like moms and dad arguing or maybe just a wild household. Most student need full attention to learn. The students need a classroom environment somewhere to write, focus, and learn. Also half students learn not only visuals, but by hands on work and being guided, but since there at home there's no teacher to help or guide them. Hypothetically if this would happen more kids would not show up to school or attend late because, they have to learn from home and they are more likely to procrastinate and not do work.\\n\\nThen socially wise; students lose a lot\\xa0of social skills and will probably due too lack communication skills by not talking or being social with other students. Therefore the younger students in elementary won't know what recess is or maybe snack time, there just the basic essentials of a normal elementary childhood that these kids will never know about. The students will also be more isolated they won't go to public and private schools and meet new kids from different areas and just experience new things. Also some students don't even have Internet or a computer to even do school at home. Then some kids have brother and siblings and sometimes they are caress so what if your siblings or your pet break your computer or the internet or power all around just go out.\\n\\nThe schools should think about precautions of that because, what if one of the students gets there stuff taken or they lose it then they will not get there work done. Also students that wanna play sports can't play for the school now because everything is at home now. Therefore every school club or activities they wanted to play or do because they do not go to school. Also if this took places how are teachers really helping the child if they have to attend to the whole class online, that means students are all not getting the right attention and help they need. Also how will they take there end of the year test also from home?, no cause they would probably cheat or get help.\\n\\nNow if you think about teachers too, they are human so if a teacher doesn't call the students or all of them are not awake at the time then who's gonna teach them, thats right nobody or they will have to attend online class late because of a substitute. Then also if the students need to ask a teacher for help the most they can do is show them from a screen. Most likely classes like p. e and other classes like that won't even be taught any more unless they do jumping jacks etc at home but they will not be in a traditional gym. Then most likely knowing students they have more time on there hands because while kids are at school at a know safe environment but\\xa0,there home might not be even a safe environment for learning. Also it just looses the interest of a traditional classroom.\\n\\nSo facts have proven that kids learn better in a classroom than online. Also classroom learning is the best way for students to learn and understand. So the benefits from learning from you would not have many of. Most kids would not even have school friends or do school things like a normal student. So this is why i think online learning is not beneficial.\",\n",
       " \"In my opinion, The school shouldn't have to follow the model by extending the school day two hours. because schools have seven hours school day and when they use two hours for that it will be not help full for students because student. when we use the same amount of time for school that is better for me because student have more time. If we want to make our life easy or conferrable it is not help full. for example if we have a two hours expanding the school day its not helping us because the using our schedule. All school schedule is help full for all who attend the school. so we don't have to use the two hours expanding the school day. The energy of the four-day two hours extending schools extending is not help full for me so. The school follow the school management systems.\\n\\nwe dont have to use the two hours extending police. because,it is not help full for who attend the school and who need more time for his/her class. fore example some student need more time to do the Home work, and assignment. its not helping for that kind of student, some student need more to understand . it mean it is not help full the four-day school week and the extending the school day for two hours. Finally the am disagree with this idea its doesnt help student and teacher in the other way. school have to follow his extending police.\",\n",
       " 'Distance learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, with many students and educators turning to online classes as a way to learn and teach. While distance learning has its advantages, it also has its disadvantages. In this essay, I will explore the pros and cons of distance learning in the educational context and analyze how this method can be beneficial or detrimental to students in various situations.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of distance learning is flexibility. Students can learn at their own pace, on their own schedule, and from anywhere with an internet connection. This can be particularly beneficial for students who have other commitments, such as jobs or family responsibilities, that make it difficult to attend traditional classes. Additionally, distance learning allows students to choose from a wider range of courses and programs, as they are not limited to those offered by their local school or university.\\n\\nAnother advantage of distance learning is that it can be more cost-effective than traditional classroom learning. Students do not have to pay for transportation, housing, or other expenses associated with attending classes on campus. Additionally, many online courses are offered for free or at a lower cost than traditional courses.\\n\\nHowever, there are also some disadvantages to distance learning. One of the main disadvantages is that it can be isolating. Students may miss out on the social interaction and support that comes with attending classes on campus. This can be particularly difficult for students who are new to a school or program, as they may not have the same opportunities to make connections with their peers and professors.\\n\\nAnother disadvantage of distance learning is that it can be more challenging to stay motivated. Without the structure of a traditional classroom, students may struggle to keep up with their coursework and stay on track. Additionally, students may have difficulty staying organized and managing their time effectively, which can lead to poor academic performance.\\n\\nIn conclusion, distance learning has both advantages and disadvantages. While it offers flexibility and cost savings, it can also be isolating and challenging to stay motivated. Ultimately, the effectiveness of distance learning will depend on the individual student and their specific situation. For some students, the benefits of distance learning may outweigh the drawbacks, while for others, traditional classroom learning may be a better fit.',\n",
       " 'As an eighth-grade student, I have always been fascinated by the world of modeling. I have always been intrigued by the way models walk, pose for pictures, and show off clothing and other materials. So, I decided to research modeling companies, visit a modeling company, and learn how to properly show off clothing and other materials.\\n\\nMy research led me to discover that there are many modeling companies in the world, but not all of them are created equal. Some modeling companies are well-known and have a reputation for producing high-quality models, while others are not as well-known but may still be worth considering.\\n\\nAfter doing some research, I decided to visit a local modeling company to learn more about their process and how they work. When I arrived at the studio, I was greeted by a friendly receptionist who showed me around the space. The studio was large and well-lit, with plenty of space for models to practice their poses and walk.\\n\\nI was then introduced to the modeling coach, who showed me how to properly walk and pose for pictures. She taught me how to keep my posture straight, how to move my hips and shoulders, and how to use my hands to add emphasis to my poses. She also showed me how to properly show off clothing and other materials, by turning my body to the side and using my hands to accentuate the features of the clothing.\\n\\nI practiced walking and posing for pictures for several hours, and by the end of the day, I felt like I had made significant progress. I was able to walk with confidence and grace, and I was able to pose for pictures in a way that showcased my best features.\\n\\nOverall, I am very grateful for the opportunity to research modeling companies, visit a modeling company, and learn how to properly show off clothing and other materials. I believe that this experience will be very valuable to me in the future, as I continue to explore my interests and pursue my goals.',\n",
       " 'As an eighth-grade student, I believe that having a positive attitude is crucial to achieving success in any aspect of life. In this essay, I will discuss three ways in which a positive attitude can help an individual succeed, along with examples to support each point.\\n\\nFirstly, a positive attitude can help individuals overcome obstacles and setbacks. When faced with challenges, people with a positive attitude tend to view them as opportunities for growth and learning, rather than as insurmountable barriers. For example, a student who receives a low score on a test may become discouraged and give up on studying, while a student with a positive attitude may view the test as a learning experience and use it to identify areas where they need to improve.\\n\\nSecondly, a positive attitude can help individuals stay motivated and focused. When people have a positive outlook on life, they are more likely to feel energized and motivated to work towards their goals. For example, an athlete with a positive attitude may be more likely to train harder and perform better in competition, while an employee with a positive attitude may be more likely to take on new challenges and excel in their job.\\n\\nFinally, a positive attitude can help individuals build strong relationships and connections with others. When people are positive and optimistic, they tend to be more approachable and easy to talk to, which can help them form deeper connections with others. For example, a person with a positive attitude may be more likely to make friends and build strong relationships with their colleagues, which can lead to greater success in both their personal and professional lives.\\n\\nIn conclusion, having a positive attitude is essential to achieving success in any aspect of life. By viewing challenges as opportunities for growth, staying motivated and focused, and building strong relationships with others, individuals can overcome obstacles, achieve their goals, and lead fulfilling lives.',\n",
       " 'They come in red, blue, green, black, and white. They beep and honk while they ride on highways and transport people form place to place. Cars are everywear. What would the world be like if we didnt have cars? What are the benefits of life without cars? Life with out cars benefits the environment, and peoples\\' health.\\n\\nFirst of all, the elimination of cars helps the environment. \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States\" (5). In other words, cars are higly responsible for the harmful gases that pollute our atmosphere and cause global warming. In Paris,\\xa0 a partial driving ban was issued to clear the air after days of high air pollution rates. After the driving ban, \"congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after five-days of intensifying smog\" (14). By using cars less, citizens can reduce pollution and help keep our earth clean and safe. Statisticts show that fewer people\\xa0 are using cars around the world. \"A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009\" (41). Sociologists belive that this trend will continue and possibly increase. They belive it will \"have benficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America\\'s emissions\" (34).\\n\\nAnother benefit to limiting car usage is that it will benefit the health of citizens both mentally and physically. In the German suburb of\\xa0 Vauban, citizens have given up their cars. A resident there says \"when i had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way\" (3). Limiting car use also limits the frequency of trafic jams, accidents, and unfriendly drivers in a hurry along with the stress and frustration that accompany them. In Colombia\\'s capital, Bogata, the Day Without Cars has had many participants. One of whom said \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress\" referring to the event. (24) limiting stress can have major benefits to a persons health and mental well-being. limiting the use of cars does\\'nt just positivly effect mental health, it can positivly influence physical health. In Bogata, Colombia, the car-free day inspired residents to \"hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work \" (20). Excersize releases endorphins which are chemicals in the brain related to pleasure. Many people that excersize regularly are happier then when they don\\'t. By limiting car usage,citizens are more inspired to excersize making them happier and healthier.\\n\\nIn sumation, a life without cars means a healthy, long-lasting planet along with a happy, relaxed, and healthy population. Even though cars are conveint, they have many negative side effects. Next time you want to go for a ride, think of all the benefits of limiting them. Rember what a breath of fresh air feels like because the gasses from cars might mean they will be gone soon. Get used to angry faces honking horns, and being given \"the bird\" by angry drivers because with cars come many conveiniences, but also many frustations.    ',\n",
       " \"Have you seen the Face on Mars? It was twenty five years ago when NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars and snapped a photo of a landform that looked much like a human face. We, NASA, have noticed many people made conspiracy theories about the Face being made by aliens. We assure you this is not true. NASA wishes that there was an acient civilization on Mars that constructed the Face. The Face is a natural landform.\\n\\nThe Face is not an alien monument. Eighteen long years after the first mission and the first photograph was taken, Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in September, 1997. Chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, Jim Garvin explained that we felt this was important to taxpayers, so we photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it. On April 5, 1998, MGS finally flew over the Face and snapped a photo ten times shaper than the orginal. This photo revealed a natural landform. If aliens did create the Face, there would be other clearer signs of alien work. For example, there would be huts, small shack figures or even Egyptain-style pyramids. Therefore, there was no alien monument after all, but not everyone was satisfied, so in 2001, NASA got another photo of it, much clearer and closer this time. It was still just a natural landform.\\n\\nNASA went through a lot to get the three photos of the Face. The first one in 1976, the second in 1998, and the third in 2001. These three photos have shown everyone very clearly that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. Some even say it reminds then of a butte or mesa, landforms common around the American West. In conclusion, the Face on Mars is, in fact, a natural landform. \",\n",

       " 'Soccer, student council, and debate\\xa0are all examples of extra curricular activities that will benefit students greatly in their future. You learn many life lessons while playing a sport, communicating with others, and debating. Being exposed to this type of activity from a young age will ensure your success in later years.\\n\\nPlaying a sport teaches you resilience, and how to work with a team. Loosing a sports game does not\\xa0feel good but its something every one has experienced. Although not everyone knows how to handle losing. When you are taught from a young age how to be resilient and bounce back from a lose, it will be much easier to handle those losses as an adult. Playing a sport also requires team work, you have to work with your team to score a goal. Learning how to communicate with your team mates is very similar to communication in the work place.\\n\\nBeing on the student council is all about communicating with your peers. If this communicating is not done properly or clearly it will be very hard to get work done. When you get a job as an adult clear communication will be mandatory.\\xa0If you do not communicate properly, someone could end up doing something differently then you intended. In student council, students will learn how to communicate with their peers. By doing this, communication as adults will be much easier. Even in disagreements your communication will be essential.\\n\\nDebate teaches students how to argue respectfully while still getting your point across. You will encounter many arguments in your life so knowing a way to argue with out hurting anyone is a curtail life lesson. Arguments between friends, and families are very common, but these are people you love and always want by your side. Knowing how to argue kindly and not escalating to a fight is very important.\\n\\nSchool offering a variety of mandatory extracurricular actives is a great idea. This way students can learn important life lessons while doing something they enjoy. These actives\\xa0teach children important lessons from knowing how to handle losing, communication with others, and even how to respectfully settle an argument. Being exposed to this type of activity from a young age will ensure great success in later years of life.',\n",
       " 'Dear Principal,\\n\\nI think its unfair that students need at least a \"B\" to participate in any after school activities such as sports or clubs. Students spend more than seven hours a day at school. Sometimes it can be very stressful. With homework or test or even having to wake up so early in the morning. This is why i believe students should have the ability to relax after school and do fun things with their friends. I\\'m sure you can suggest other possible ideas for not having after school sports or activities. For example, suggest tutors, parent help or even teacher help. The teachers will best understand the assignments or topic and maybe the student doesn\\'t understand. There are other ways for dealing with it. Sports and activities are very popular and a big thing in a kids life. Plus they need physical exercise to stay fit and you should not take that away. I know having a \"C\" isn\\'t great but give them time to catch up and get a \"B\" or better an \"A\". Also, there needs to be something wrong with how things our being tough if most students have C\\' s This is your fault for not teaching them right or good enough. The students need to understand things in order to learn and get good grades.\\n\\nBut, have a new policy. Which is help the students learn better. Possibly make a club where students can come do there homework and get help when they don\\'t understand something. School is a place to learn but also to have fun. Teach things more understandable so that we can enjoy the fun thing like sports and clubs. Sports can be a huge part in a persons life. It can make you a professional athlete or a young actress, by participating in basketball or drama club. If things are going on at home for a student like family issues they may not want to be at home with all the fighting, they would want to be at school, having fun with their friends. If you took away these privileges you\\'ll just start more of a fight with the parents and students. Maybe it might even make students grades worse, because of all the stress and school and not being able to let it out by doing sports, clubs and activities. Also think of the coaches point of view. It is their job to teach them, but how can they when you wont let them. This is obviously something they love doing and know they get to teach it to other young students. What if you were a kid at this school? What if you had these activities taken away from you? How would this affect you?

However, while I agree that being true to oneself is important, I believe that it is not the only factor that should be considered when determining the greatest accomplishment. In fact, I believe that having help from school, teachers, and groups is crucial in achieving success in life.\\n\\nFirstly, school plays a vital role in shaping young minds and providing students with the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed in life. Without a proper education, it can be difficult for individuals to achieve their full potential. Teachers, in particular, are essential in guiding students and helping them develop their unique talents and abilities. They provide feedback, offer guidance, and encourage students to pursue their passions. By having access to quality education and the support of dedicated teachers, students are better equipped to navigate the challenges of the world and achieve their goals.\\n\\nSecondly, groups and communities can also provide valuable support and guidance to individuals. Whether it be through sports teams, clubs, or volunteer organizations, being part of a group can provide a sense of belonging and purpose. Groups can also offer opportunities for personal growth and development, as individuals learn to work collaboratively and develop leadership skills. Furthermore, groups can provide a support system, as members can offer advice, encouragement, and a listening ear when needed.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while being true to oneself is important, it is not the only factor that should be considered when determining the greatest accomplishment.

       " 'Is there a face is on Mars? I would say no, the face on Mars is not an alien artifact. There are shadows that can make it seem like a face ,but shadows can alter thing appearnces. April 5th, 1998, and April 8th 2001 have clearer images that can prove that prove that it is also not alien. Unlike the photos of the Viking 1 in 1976 ,which were older and were less clear. So the Face is not real because of, the later more clearer images prove that it is not, and shadows can alter one\\'s apperance.\\n\\nFirst off, the Face on the isn\\'t a face it is a rock on Mars, that had shaows that made it look like face. People and imgaes can come about blurry ,and may looklike something else. Also pixels also can help make things seem like they are not what the they are. Like the picture in April 8th, 2001 pixels made it look clearer. A compasrion can be shared of the 1976 picture to the 2001 picture, \"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo\"(10). There is comparaion toeach photo that was taken and as time went on it got clearer and showed less of a face. Which makes it more of reason it is not an ailean artifact.\\n\\nNext, on April 5th ,1998 after the 1976 Viking picture of the face on Mars became a hit. NASA wanted to go take another picture ,because people keppsying it was made by aliens,it was difficult though. After NASA had gotten the photo though,it was more clear, which again proves that it is not an alien artifact. Even in the passage it states about it ,\"Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture tne times sharper than the origianl Viking photos\"(7). After that it was on the web people realized that it is a land form not a alien structure. So it is a fact that it is not an alien artifact.\\n\\nFinally, On april 8th ,2001, people still were blieving that alien made the landform. So NASA snapped another picture, in the passage it states \"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view\"(10). This mean they had gotten a good angle on the Face. And the picture was more clearer again. They had proven to the world that the Face was not alien. It was a landform.\\n\\nMy oppionent might state to me though that we did not see the real deal on screen just with a picture. They could of had edited it to make not alien. That is true but in 2001 they didn\\'t have good editing system unlike we do today. So that image can not be really edited.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Face is not alien the images of April 8th, 2001 and April 5th, 1998 can prove this. Also there are not editing system theat were really good to photo shop back then, and it had been proven many times by NASA that it is not.   ',\n",

That it was some type of communication from aliens or that it was a warning that aliens from Mars were going to come to Earth. In the end these people where wrong and started to commonly be reffered to as conspiracy theorists. The human faces of Mars are really just natural landforms and NASA has been proving that for years.\\n\\nIf you were one of the people told to discover the truth about the faces would you stay calm, or buckle under the pressure? Many people in NASA stayed calm and put together compelling evidence that the landforms were completely natural occurances. In paragraph two of \"Unmasking the Face on Mars.\" it is said that \"Scietists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusualy shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" This shows that the landforms were common on the planet, this certain one just had unusual shadows.

When the face was made public many people and buisnesses jumped on the idea of telling the world made up facts or lies about the face, that it wasn\\'t a natural occurance or that it was a sign from aliens. In paragraph five of the article it says \"It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-- even haunted grovery store checkout lines for 25 years! Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-- evidence that NASA would rather hide...\" This proves that people jumped at the idea of going against NASA and telling the world that the Face was something to fear, instead of something to admire.\\n\\nAfter another spacecraft was sent to take a picture people still weren\\'t satisfied. In paragraph eight it talks about how the second aircraft that took a picture was stuck behind clouds and people thought the image taken may be distorted in some way. To please the people NASA sent another aircraft to Mars to take yet another picture, but it wasn\\'t easy. In paragraph nine it says \"Mission controllers prepared to look again. \"It\\'s not easy to target Cydonia,\" says Garvin... Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in a narrow 2.5 km-wide strips. \"We just don\\'t pass over the Face very often.\" This statement proves that NASA would do anything to prove the landform was a natural occurance and when the picture came in, the doubts stopped. In the last paragraph it is stated that \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West.\" This put to rest the crazy theories of alien communication and proved what the face really was, a naturally occuring landform no different than others of its kind.\\n\\nWhen you first heard about the face did you believe NASA\\'s explanation or the Hollywood version? If you did believe NASA good job, not many people did, but if you were one of the Hollywood believers that is okay. Hollywood manipulated the face to make it look like something it wasn\\'t and people believed them. In paragraph five it says \"The \"Face on Mars\" has since become a pop icon.\" This means that you were not alone. The theorists believed Hollywood in what they said about the face. They also thought that since NASA was sending so many aircrafts to get a picture of it, they were just trying to cover up the truth. This is what many people thought for years, but finally the truth came out.\\n\\nNow the \"Face on Mars\" is still big in Hollywood, but more to the truthful side. Less and less people believe the conspiracy\\'s thoughts and ideas about the face and started to believe the facts. For years people were in the dark about what the face really was and when it came out people still denied it, but slowly began to warm up to the idea, that the face was a landform, much like the ones here one Earth and maybe people will remember this the next time we find something phenominal on another planet.',\n",

       " 'Cell phones have become an integral part of our lives. They are used for communication, entertainment, and even education. However, the use of cell phones in school has been a topic of debate for years. Some people argue that allowing students to use their phones in the classroom can be beneficial, while others believe that it can be detrimental. In this essay, I will evaluate the use of cell phones in school and consider the benefits and drawbacks of allowing students to use their phones in the classroom.\\n\\nOne of the main benefits of allowing students to use their phones in the classroom is that it can enhance communication between students and teachers. Cell phones allow students to easily communicate with their teachers and classmates, even outside of the classroom. This can be especially helpful for students who have difficulty communicating in person or who are shy or introverted. Additionally, cell phones can be used to access educational resources and apps that can help students learn more effectively.\\n\\nHowever, there are also several drawbacks to allowing students to use their phones in the classroom. One of the main concerns is that cell phones can be a distraction to students. They can be used to play games, watch videos, and scroll through social media, which can take away from the learning experience. Additionally, cell phones can be a source of cheating and plagiarism, as students can easily access information online.\\n\\nAnother potential drawback of allowing students to use their phones in the classroom is that it can be difficult to enforce rules and regulations. If students are allowed to use their phones, it can be difficult to confiscate them if they are misusing them. This can lead to a lack of discipline and can create a negative environment in the classroom.\\n\\nAlternative solutions to allowing students to use their phones in the classroom include confiscation. Confiscating cell phones can be an effective way to prevent students from using them in the classroom, but it can also be seen as punitive and can create a negative relationship between students and teachers. Additionally, confiscating cell phones can be difficult to enforce, as students can easily find ways to get them back.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the use of cell phones in school is a complex issue that requires careful consideration. While there are benefits to allowing students to use their phones in the classroom, there are also potential drawbacks that must be taken into account. Ultimately, the decision of whether to allow students to use their',\n",
       " \"Dear,state senator\\n\\nThe Electoral College voting method is a very debated subject among the people. That is why I am here to explain to you my opinion on it, and why i think that the whole process needs to be stopped. As you can probably already tell, I completely dis like the whole process all together but anyway here is my letter to you.\\n\\nThe first issue with this process is that there is not that much stability to it. When people vote for who they want as president they're giving their votes to some one else just so the person they gave them to can vote for who they want to,not for the elector that that person actually put down on the ballet. We the people are not even the ones who technically get to pick who we want as president, it's the electors.\\n\\nThis being said brings me to my next point,what is the point of the people voting if we arent even the ones who get to pick the representatives? Yes, they say that when people are voting,they are actually voting for electors but what if the electors dont listen to the peoples votes and only vote for who they want? It is true that the slate of electors is trusted to vote for the parties person they want to elect but, there is always that tiny percentage that the electors can break that trust. When they take these chances they are setting themselves up for disaster.\\n\\nI hope that you take what I said into consideration. These are just a few of the things that are wrong with the Electoral College system. Its only a matter of time before people like me start to realize everything wrong with the system we have now, and when they do realize the things wrong with it, they will want something done about it. Please help get a better system going and end this Electoral College crap we have now.       \\xa0    \",\n",
       " \"Over 25% of students struggle to focus and learn in public schools. Most public schools can be beneficial in some ways that can help students. There is another option if you don't want to attend a school you can take online courses which help keep people that are not able to go to school. Most students go to a public school and do not take the online classes because they were raised that way. The reasons why online classes are beneficial because students can get one on one help with many different teachers and they can fix the classes to their schedule.\\n\\nOne reason online courses are beneficial is because students can get one on one help for a variety of courses if needed. Some students struggle\\xa0and they don't know what to do first or they don't remember how to do it. Most students have trouble remembering\\xa0how to start but if they do online courses they can video call a teacher for help or advice. Sometimes students need a recap of the lessons that they did on previous courses. On online classes they teachers that are on their for almost the whole day and students can contact them whenever needed. The students can ask for help at almost any time they want and teachers will be prepared and waiting to provide one on one help with students. Most students can't contact a teacher when they need help and are in normal classes that's why online courses are more beneficial to the students.\\n\\nSecondly, students can adjust classes to their schedule depending on the amount of time they have. Sometimes students have trouble trying to schedule their activities and sometimes school gets in the way of those activities. Students that have that trouble can schedule their courses depending on what time they have available. Online classes dont take very long to complete and can be easily fit into a busy schedule. Students can do the classes on any device which allows them to do it anywhere at any time. Students can do online classes at any time frame that they are available at. Their classes start and finish time revolve around the time frame that they set themselves.\\n\\nOn the other hand parents\\xa0still think that it is healthy to let their children go to schools that have those bad environments. Most of the parents say that it helps them be more social and keeps them from staying in the house too often. The solution to this long going problem ,of taking physical classes with crowded class rooms and many distractions, is to let their children take online courses. Many of the students that take online courses have had problem with public schools like crowded rooms or big class sizes. Students have trouble focusing in classes that have larger number in it. The students mind has difficulty focusing because of all of the ca-motion that is in the room.\\n\\nIn conclusion online courses benefit the students a lot more than the average classroom does.\\n\\nMany students that take online classes have higher scores than normal students because online classes provide more help. Most students that are in normal classes struggle because they don't have one on one help. The many students that have online courses are more happy and have more free time than normal students. Students prefer online classes because it revolves around their schedule and they can get one on one help with work.\",\n",

You need to think about it more because in my eyes policy 1 is going to be the best.\\n\\nThe reason i think policy 1 is the best is because what if they were to walk home every day how are there parents going to know if they are okay? And if you get hurt on the way home from school then you can get a hold of your parents and get them to come get you. It would make a hold up at a school less dangerous because they can tell you in a text if any one has been hurt or what's going on.\\n\\nOne other reason we should allow phones is because you can get bored with your classmates. So you can talk to other people and not get in so much trouble for cell phones. Also more people will enjoy coming to school and be more quite during class. that is the reason policy 1 is the best for school.\\n\\nYours truly,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME\",\n",
       " 'Summer projects are a great way for students to continue learning during the break. I think that these projects should be student-designed. This way, students can choose a topic that they are interested in and that they will enjoy learning about. This will make the learning experience more enjoyable and meaningful for them.\\n\\nFor example, if a student is interested in science, they could design a project that involves conducting experiments and collecting data. They could then analyze the data and present their findings in a report or presentation. This will not only help them learn about science, but it will also give them the opportunity to develop their research and critical thinking skills.\\n\\nOn the other hand, if a teacher designs the project, it may not be as engaging for the student. The student may not have a choice in the topic, and they may not be as motivated to complete the project. This could lead to a negative learning experience, and the student may not learn as much.\\n\\nFurthermore, student-designed projects allow students to take ownership of their learning. They can choose a topic that they are passionate about, and they can design the project in a way that is meaningful to them. This will help them develop their creativity and problem-solving skills, as well as their ability to work independently.\\n\\nIn conclusion, student-designed summer projects are the way to go. They allow students to take ownership of their learning, choose topics that they are interested in, and develop important skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving. These projects will be more engaging and meaningful for students, and they will help students continue learning during the summer break.',\n",

       " \"Some schools require students to complete a summer project to assure they continue learning over their break. Although some may disagree, teachers should design the project. Those who disagree state that students would be more involved if they designed it themselves or chose their own prompt, but these are simply not true. The best way a summer project should be carried out is with a teacher's design, and here's why.\\n\\nFirst off, teachers are the ones who shall grade it, so they should be the ones who choose the guidelines for that grade. This gives teachers the ability to give all the students the same thing but pick out which projects were done good. If every student designed their own project then there would be no control for what is good and what is bad. On top of that, when students all have a teacher designed project it makes it so they have to reach a certain level of effort, and not just be lazy and write two sentences. Allowing students to design their own project would most definitely enable some more lazy projects.\\n\\nIn addition, some students prefer to have something structured and guided so they dont have to create everything from scratch. Projects can be hard to completely design without any loopholes or flaws. Some students simply lack the creativity to think up a whole project on their own. Projects could be anything, from a potato being observed to a summer book review. Giving students that much freedom would only cause confusion among them and the teacher trying to grade many very different projects. The projects would be incomparable, so how would a teacher be able to argue that one is bad and another isn't. What if students want to help each other on their projects? well they cant if every project is unique; however, if given a prompt they can cooperate and benefit from each other in creating a unique, yet immaculate project.\\n\\nAlthough some may disagree, students should not be allowed to design their own summer projects, they would be less efficient and become easily not gradable. Those who disagree with this statement say that students feel more relaxed doing their own project, and are more enthusiastic if they have full creative control. However, these statements are simply not true. In the end, there is many reasons why teachers should control summer projects, and whether students like it or not, it is better for all if the teacher designs them.\\xa0\",\n",

       " \"Not all students are the same and their varied conditions may affect their opportunity to obtain an education. Distance learning is a new innovative technique that some schools implement to offer online education at home. This technique can be offered in many ways such as: online video, conferencing, and online courses. Distance learning can be very beneficial for all students in any level of education. I think that students should be given the opportunity to obtain distance learning because it can be very convenient for students who suffer from illnesses and can't attend school, it allows students to work at their own pace, and it allows students to work when it is mostly convenient for them.\\n\\nImplementing distance learning can decrease the attendance issue most schools face. Students miss school due to many factors; One of the main reasons why students miss schools is due to illnesses. Students who deal with very severe illnesses such as cancer are forced to not attend school for long periods of time. Which can hinder the student's future. Even illnesses that aren't very severe can still negatively affect students because most illnesses can be easily transmitted, such as the common cold, which can put other students' health at risk. To prevent this issue schools should offer distance learning by allowing the students to attend classes from anywhere whether it's their homes or hospitals. Students who suffer from health problems don't have to miss out on their education and get the same opportunity to learn like every healthy student.\\n\\nDistance learning also allows students to work at their own pace which can be an advantage to students; Specially to those who have learning disabilities. Teachers work at the same pace with every\\xa0student. Which isn't helpful for students as their minds work differently and their comprehension levels vary. Some students learn slower than others and most teachers don't recognize that. With distance learning each student can learn at the pace that is appropriate\\xa0for them. Distance learning is also very helpful as the teacher's focus shifts to each individual student rather than the class as a whole. Online conferencing allows the teacher to understand the student more and asses their abilities. This helps teachers divide students based on what learning techniques is appropriate for them. Which can result in increased student performance.\\n\\nDistance learning is very beneficial for students as they have the option to work when they are motivated and when it is convenient for them. Most students attend school with less than 5 hours to sleep due to sleeping late because of homework. Students who have the opportunity to work from home don't have to wake up early. Distance learning allows students to do online courses when they are energized, which doesn't have to be in the morning. This can improve the student's efficiency level and improve their performance. Not all students' physiological needs are met yet they are expected to work with no breaks during school hours. This is due to school hours not being enough for teachers to cover all the content that needs to be covered. Distance learning allows students to take breaks when they feel the need to. Giving students this autonomy can be more motivating to them.\\n\\nOverall students' conditions vary from student to student. Each student is unique in that they have different minds and thinking levels. Which is why i believe that distance learning is a very innovative and useful technique that should be provided by all schools as learning option for students. Distance learning provides many opportunities for all students because it can is very useful for students who are sick and can't attend school, it can be helpful for students as they are working at their own pace, and it allows students to work whenever is convenient to them.\",\n",

By using example of the human face muscles and Mona Lisa as an example, allows us to get into debt about our facial expression and what they give out to other people.\\n\\nThe use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of student in a classroom is valuable because it will be able to read the muscles in the face that are being used in the expression we are doing. \" The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major musces in the model must move like human musces.\"\\n\\nBy creating a 3-D model of the face it allows it to have an exact replication of the face and muscles being used; therefore it will be able to show how people are really feeling. \"Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, and, disgust, fear and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.\" By classifying every emotion with the musces allows the technology to get an an acurrate feeling of the person.\\n\\nThe use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of a studemt in a classroom is valuable because in the passage it gives examples of the exact muscle and emotion that correlate with each other. \" For eample, your fronttalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you\\'re surprised; your arbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. In the real smile, the zygomtic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of you mouth. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different musle, the risorius.\" By using the muscles in the face, this allows us to see an exact repredention of the emotions the person is feeling and will help kids in the classrooms.\\n\\nThe use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of a studemt in a classroom is valuable because it will allow the student to feel more comfortable in their learning enviroment and lern at their own pace. \" \\'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\\' Dr. Huang predicts. \\'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\\' \" By having this technology it will allow students to be more engaged in the learning and be able to undestand better the subject.

       " 'In the digital age, where information is readily available at our fingertips, the role of libraries has been questioned. Some argue that libraries have become obsolete, while others believe they are still crucial to our society. In my opinion, libraries continue to play an essential role in our communities and should be valued and supported.\\n\\nFirstly, libraries provide access to a wide range of resources for people from all walks of life. Not everyone has the means to purchase books or subscribe to online databases, but libraries offer these resources for free. They also offer access to computers and the internet, which is vital for those who cannot afford these technologies at home. For example, students who come from low-income families rely on their local library for research materials and a quiet place to study.\\n\\nSecondly, libraries serve as community hubs where people can come together for various activities such as book clubs, workshops, and events. These gatherings foster a sense of community and promote literacy and learning. Libraries also provide a safe space for individuals who may not have one elsewhere. For instance, homeless individuals often use libraries as a refuge during extreme weather conditions.\\n\\nLastly, libraries play a critical role in preserving our history and culture. They house archives, rare books, and historical documents that might otherwise be lost or inaccessible to the public. Libraries ensure that future generations can learn about our past and understand the evolution of our society.\\n\\nIn conclusion, libraries remain relevant and necessary in the digital age. They provide equal access to information, serve as community centers, and preserve our history and culture. It is crucial that we continue to support and fund our libraries to ensure they can carry out their vital functions for years to come.',\n",
       " 'Deciding on a career path when leaving high school can be a daunting task for many students. There are a lot of options out there and many pros and cons to consider. While considering these pros and cons, it is important for students to look at both the benefits and drawbacks of making a decision at a young age versus waiting until after high school. \\n\\nOn one hand, many parents urge their young children to start planning for college and a career early, therefore making a decision at a young age. Making a decision early allows students to focus their studies on the type of career or field they wish to pursue, and gives them an opportunity to specialize in something they truly enjoy. On the other hand, making a decision too soon can be difficult if the student ends up not liking what they chose, and may lead to them feeling a lack of commitment or being stuck with a decision that was made too early. \\n\\nWaiting until after high school may give students more time to explore different options and find something they are actually passionate about. However, this can lead to students feeling lost or unsure of what direction they should take. Additionally, waiting too long may lead to students not knowing where to begin or feeling overwhelmed by the number of options available.\\n\\nIn the end, it is up to the student to decide which path is right for them—make a decision early and focus their studies on something they are passionate about, or wait and explore different options before making a final decision.',\n",
       " \"Sure, I'll give it a try! Here's my essay on the advantages of providing examples in order to influence others:\\n\\nHey there,\\n\\nProviding examples is like, super important when you're trying to convince someone of something. Like, think about it, when you're trying to explain to your friend why they should try a new food, you're gonna show them a picture of what it looks like, right? Or when you're trying to convince your parents to let you go to a concert, you're gonna tell them about how great the band is and show them videos of their performances. Examples are like, the best way to get your point across and make someone understand what you're trying to say.\\n\\nFirst of all, providing examples helps to make things more relatable. Like, if you're trying to explain a complicated concept to someone, you can use an example that they can relate to. For instance, if you're trying to explain what a tornado is, you could show them a video of one or take them to a place where they can see one in person. It makes it way easier for them to understand what you're talking about.\\n\\nAnother advantage of providing examples is that it helps to make your argument more convincing. Like, if you're trying to convince someone that a certain policy is good, you can show them examples of how it's worked in other places. For example, if you're trying to convince your school to start a recycling program, you could show them how other schools have successfully implemented similar programs and how it's helped the environment. It makes your argument way more convincing when you can show concrete examples of how something works.\\n\\nProviding examples also helps to make your point more engaging. Like, if you're trying to tell a story, you can use examples to make it more interesting and exciting. For instance, if you're trying to tell a story about a cool trip you took, you could describe the sights and sounds of the places you visited. It makes the story way more fun to listen to and way more memorable.\\n\\nFinally, providing examples can help to build trust. Like, if you're trying to convince someone of something, they might be more likely to believe you if\",\n",

       " \"Dear Principle,\\n\\nI would like to put in a nice way that my opinions are different from yours. My opinions are different because, I, myself have two C's. It is not my fault that those subjects are not my strongest. Why should I or any other students be punished for it? Getting a C is average, nothing bad. Students with a C average should be getting help from a tutor maybe but shouldn't be cut from sports.\\n\\nHaving sports is a healthy activity. It keeps us in shape and keeps us out of doing bad things like stealing or doing drugs. It also gets our energy out. Without sports I would be bored a lot. We also see our friends during sorts and we make new sports. Having sports prepare us for the real world by helping us meet and cooperate with new people.\\n\\nInstead of taking away our activities talk to us. Maybe it's not sports that is causing our grade. It could be the teachers or our peers. I understand why grades are important so you should have an after school club for homework and school help. That way we can be with friends and help our grades. I hope you consider my points and don't take away sports. It would be such a shame.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME\",\n",
       " 'Dear Principal,\\n\\nHi, my name is STUDENT_NAME, and I am a student at your school. I believe that policy 2, \"do not allow students to have phones at school at all\", is the better policy. I think this because students might try to cheat on tests with their phones, get distracted during class or distract others, and the phones might get lost or stolen which would destroy the tight community.\\n\\nStudents might not follow the rules of turning the phone off during class time. They\\'re most likely to use it to cheat on a test. For example, if you were a student and just spent all of last night working on your homework, got almost no sleep, and you suddenly realize that there\\'s a big test today that you forgot to study for. Would you as a student go with the F? Or would you try to cheat on your cell phone so that you could pass the test? Students don\\'t like getting bad grades because their parents ground them or punish them for it. If students can have a way out of getting this F on their test which would later pull down their final grade, then they would do it.\\n\\n\"Beep, beep,\" the cell phone rings. You\\'re taking a test and you look up to see that the kid in front of you is texting. The annoying tap of the keyboard distracts you from your work and it starts to get harder and harder to think. You lose your train of thought. \"Time\\'s up,\" the teacher says and you groan, because you knew the answer to the last question, but because of the cell phone, you forgot what to write. Now instead of getting an A on your quiz, you are getting a B. This is what happens when kids bring their cell phones to school. Kids become busy with texting and don\\'t do what they\\'re supposed to and/or it leads to other kids not being able to do what they\\'re supposed to since they\\'re constantly being distracted by the person in front of them. This brings both of these kids\\' grades down and hurts someone who was sure to get an A in the first place. When cell phones distract other people, it\\'s unfair to them because they were focused in the first place, but because of someone else\\'s cell phone, they lost their thoughts and what they wanted to say.\\n\\nThe last reason I have is that cell phones might get stolen or lost and cause a heap of chaos. Imagine that you have this expensive new phone that you got on your birthday yesterday. Your parents told you not to lose it because it cost a fortune. You kept your eye on it the whole time, but during lunch, you take a quick trip to the bathroom and left your phone in your locker. When you got back, it was gone. It\\'s not a surprise that cell phones get stolen at school. Kids like the new and latest stuff and sometimes they can\\'t afford it. But if they want it really bad, they try to steal it. Friendships are broken, and enemies are made, because who knows who stole your phone? It could be anyone. Kids become more aware and less open to having new friends. Kids lose trust in each other which leads to the whole community to not be as close anymore.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the policy to not allow students to have phones at school at all is better because students might try to cheat on tests with their phones, get distracted during class or distract others, and the phones might get lost or stolen and destroy the tight community.\\n\\nAfter reading this letter, now do you agree with me that kids shouldn\\'t have cell phones at school?

       " 'Last year, a student in my classroom was caught using his cellphone during class. He pointed out that the reasoning behind it was that he was searching something that involved the class, but the teacher still took up his phone. By allowing the use of cellphones in class many students would get even more distracted than they already are. It would also be easier to cheat and get good grades, since all the information would be of easy access. On the other hand, this would make the technological integration in school even better and easier, something that many dream and believe will happen in the close future. I believe cellular devices should not be allowed during educational time.\\n\\nInitially, cellphones would draw too much of student\\'s attention. Teenagers spend enough time of their day staring at screens, and school should be a place where that doesn\\'t happen. Many are addicted to social media, and have the \"need\" to check it every 10 minutes. Sometimes when I am in class and decide to take out my phone, not looking and paying to the teacher for more than a minute makes me loose focus of class and need to ask the ones around me for help. Class is a place where students should focus and pay attention, by allowing the use of phones many would get distracted and use it for non-educational purposes which would make learning harder, since this focus should be used on what the teacher is saying instead of what their friends are posting online.\\n\\nSecondly, it would be an encouragement to cheating. With the integration of cellphones in class students would start getting better grades, since many of them would simply Google all of the answers for a worksheet instead of paying attention to the class and answering it based on what they\\'ve learned. This would make so that daily grades get better, but when test day arrives, the student who Googled every answer in the past week would get a bad grade because he didn\\'t really learn anything, all his answers were based on someone or something helping him. This would then encourage cheating, because that student would most likely realize that with the use of his cellphone daily grades were getting better, but when it came down to not using the device his grades would drop.\\n\\nHowever, it could be helpful and very easy to set up. With limitations in place, like blocking certain apps and websites that have nothing to do with school, cellphones could be useful during educational time. Technology integration in schools is already happening, many give chrome books to students so they can use it during class, but these are expensive and getting one for every student is not always viable. Everyone has a cellphone so there would be no need for extra devices ,since phones have 1000 different uses, including many that could be of help during educational time.\\n\\nThe student from my classroom which was caught using his cellphone still uses it during class, he is barely passing that class and complains that the teacher is not explaining something correctly and that is why he has such low grades. But everyone knows the reason he is almost failing is because he\\'d rather stare at his cellphone screen instead of paying attention to the teacher. Cellular devices draw too much of teenager\\'s attention and can also encourage cheating. On the other hand they can be helpful in the right occasion. I strongly disagree with the use of cellphones during educational time and believe they would cause more harm than they would help.',\n",

       " \"Standardized testing has been a topic on debate for many years. The use of standardized tests to determine a student's ability has its positives and negatives. In my opinion, standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability. In this essay, I will provide reasons and examples to support my argument.\\n\\nFirstly, standardized tests do not take into consideration a student's background, interests, and learning abilities. A student's ability to excel in school is influenced by many factors such as their home environment, their access to resources, and their interests. A student may be good in one subject but struggle with another subject. Standardized tests do not allow for this variation in abilities.\\n\\nSecondly, standardized tests do not measure critical thinking and problem-solving skills. A student's ability to think critically and solve problems is crucial for success in life. Standardized tests only measure a student's ability to recall information and answer multiple-choice questions. These tests do not test a student's creativity or their ability to think out of the box.\\n\\nFinally, standardized tests cause stress and anxiety among students. These tests are used to determine a student's future educational and career paths. The pressure placed on students to excel in these tests can be overwhelming, leading to stress and anxiety. A student's mental health should be a priority in the education system.\\n\\nIn conclusion, standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability. These tests do not take into consideration a student's background, interests, and learning abilities. Furthermore, standardized tests do not measure critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Finally, standardized tests cause stress and anxiety among students. It is imperative that educators find alternative methods to determine a student's ability and promote a stress-free learning environment for students.\",\n",
       " \"When peoples ask for advice, they somtimes talk to more than one person. This is a good thing to do because it can help them make a beter choise. For example, if someones asking for advice on what kind of dog to get, they might talk to a few differnt peoples who have dogs. One person might say that golden retrievers are the best, but another person might say that labradors are better. This helps the person making the desision because they can hear different opions and decide which one is beter for them.\\n\\nAnother reason why seeking multipe opions is good is because it can help you avoiid making a mistakes. If you only ask one person for advice, they might have a bias or not know enought about the subjet. But if you ask a few peoples, you can get a more well-ronded understanding of the situasion and make a more informed desision.\\n\\nFor instance, if someone is thinking about moving to a new city, they might talk to a few different peoples who have lived there before. One person might say that the city is great and has a lot of good jobs, but another person might say that the traffic is terrible and it's hard to get around. This helps the person making the desision because they can weigh the pros and cons and decide if it's the right choice for them.\\n\\nIn conclusion, seeking multipe opions is a good way to make a beter choise. It can help you avoiid making a mistakes and get a more well-ronded understanding of the situasion.

       " 'The people have a right to say what they want to happen in their community, state, and even as far as the country they live in. They should be able to decide whether they want a park built in their city or whether they want a specific up and coming President. Yes, popular vote at the moment seems favorable for the people, but it does not mean that the people don\\'t vote in the the process of the Electoral College. They truly do vote for their president, just not in a way that they would like. Nonetheless, they do. That being said, the system of election should be kept to the Electoral College.\\n\\nTo begin with, the Electoral College, in a sense, is not democratic, as seen in modern times but it does not mean that it is not equal. Yes, they are voting for an elector in their state, trusting that they would vote for their chosen candidate. \"But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party\\'s nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed...,\" as shown by Richard A. Posner in \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\". This means that, even though the people are voting for an elector to pass on their message, they are still voting to make sure that the president they want to take the seat will get it. The electors so rarely betray the trust of the voters it has happened one time in 2000, but again that was the first time since 1888. The most thoughtful voters will listen closely to the campaign, then choose which president they feel is fit. Which again, leads to the voters deciding, in the end. Furthermore, the larger states get more attention than the smaller states making it equal amongst those that have more population. For the most part, the Electoral College is equal.\\n\\nHowever, others can argue against the Electoral College in favor of the popular vote. \"Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always,\" said Bradford Plumer in \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong.\" That being said, sure they can\\'t control that but the elector rarely betrays the trust of the voters, only happening twice in recorded history. The Electoral College is still less likely to cause a problem than popular vote would. If popular vote were to play in hand as a system of choosing the president, then things outside of even politics such as, riots, would get out of hand. \"...in the Constitution as comprimise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens,\"as said by the Office of the Federal Register in \"What Is the Electoral College?\" Either way, voters do get popular vote, and vote for their elector to vote for their chosen President. It is a balanced idea of both a government and citizen based vote for the leader of the country.\\n\\nOverall, the Electoral College by far is a balanced system than popular vote is. It is fair, in the sense, that everybody gets a vote and in total, their votes go to what they think is best for their country. Which in turn, does allow for them to decide.',\n",

       " 'Single-use plastic products have become a hot topic in recent years due to their negative impact on the environment. There are arguments both for and against the ban of these products, and I believe that we should ban single-use plastics to help protect our planet.\\n\\nFirstly, single-use plastics are a major contributor to pollution. They often end up in our oceans and harm marine life. For example, plastic bags can be mistaken for jellyfish by sea turtles, and they can end up eating them, which can lead to serious health problems or even death. Additionally, plastic straws can get stuck in the noses of sea turtles, causing them pain and suffering. By banning single-use plastics, we can reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in our oceans and protect marine life.\\n\\nSecondly, single-use plastics are not biodegradable, which means that they will stay in the environment for hundreds of years. This can lead to a buildup of plastic waste in landfills and other areas. Furthermore, plastic waste can release harmful chemicals into the soil and water, which can be harmful to both humans and animals. By banning single-use plastics, we can reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in landfills and prevent harmful chemicals from being released into the environment.\\n\\nFinally, there are many alternatives to single-use plastics that are more environmentally friendly. For example, reusable bags, water bottles, and straws can be used multiple times, reducing the amount of waste that is produced. Additionally, biodegradable plastics are becoming more widely available, which can help reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in the environment. By promoting the use of these alternatives, we can reduce our reliance on single-use plastics and protect the environment.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the ban of single-use plastics is necessary to protect our planet. These products are a major contributor to pollution, they are not biodegradable, and there are many alternatives available that are more environmentally friendly. By taking action to ban single-use plastics, we can help protect marine life, reduce the amount of plastic waste in landfills, and promote more sustainable alternatives. It is time for us to take action and protect our planet for future generations.',\n",
       " 'limiting how much the car is used could reduce the green house gas emissions, smog would reduce, and in germany, it will save money.\\n\\nto begin with, green house gas emissions are produced by cars being used and the carbon dioxide is not leaving the atmosphere. when the sun shines light into earth\\'s atmosphere, the heat from the light rays can not escape the atmosphere because of all the carbon dioxide. this causes problems in the polar regions. due to the increasing temoatures, the ice is melting more and quicker. this causes sea levels to rise and in teh antartica region, animals can not cross the ice fast enough to get to where their food is leaving them stranded to starve. if the usage of cars was reduced, the green house effect wouldn\\'t affect people or animals as much.\\n\\nIn paris , cars are being banned due to too much smog in the area. \"after five-days of intensiving smog . . .

       " \"Dear Senator,\\n\\nI am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to advocate against changing to a system of election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The Electoral College, established by the founding fathers as a compromise between election by Congress and election by popular vote, plays a crucial role in our democratic process.\\n\\nOne of the main benefits of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. As mentioned in the text by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the likelihood of a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is significantly lower compared to a dispute over the popular vote. In addition, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes ensures that even a slight plurality in a state leads to a landslide electoral-vote victory. This creates a clear and decisive outcome in the election.\\n\\nAnother important aspect of the Electoral College is its ability to ensure that the president has trans-regional appeal. With no region having enough electoral votes to elect a president, candidates are encouraged to campaign across the country and consider the interests of various regions. This prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from being elected and ensures that all Americans feel represented by the president.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College system enhances the importance of swing states. In a close election, candidates focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states, where the outcome is uncertain. This encourages voters in those states to pay close attention to the campaign and be more thoughtful in their decision-making. These swing states become the battlegrounds where the election is truly decided, allowing for a more engaged electorate.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College restores some balance to the political influence of large states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate in the Constitution gives small states more power, and the Electoral College offsets this by providing larger states with more attention from presidential candidates. This ensures that candidates do not solely focus on the concerns of highly populated areas and consider the needs of all states.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College avoids the complication of run-off elections. By invariably producing a clear winner, it eliminates the need for further rounds of voting when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This streamlines the election process and allows for a smooth transition of power.\\n\\nWhile some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has no hope of winning, it is important to note that voters in presidential elections are individuals who want to express a political preference rather than those who believe their single vote may decide the outcome. In spite of this, approximately half of the eligible American population voted in the last presidential election, indicating that voters are still motivated to participate.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College serves as a vital component of our democratic system, providing certainty of outcome, ensuring trans-regional appeal, giving importance to swing states, balancing the influence of large and small states, and avoiding run-off elections. While arguments can be made for changing to a popular vote system, the benefits and practicality of the Electoral College outweigh them. It is crucial that we keep the Electoral College and preserve the integrity of our democratic process.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n[Your Name]\",\n",

       " \"Dear Principal,\\n\\nIt has come to my attention that you are considering a policy change in the schools athletics program. Under this new policy, students with a below B average would not be allowed to participate in athletics. Personally I agree with this idea. I believe it would be beneficial to the students and the school if this policy were enacted.\\n\\nFirst, I think it would help the students now, and later on in life, if they were required to maintain B's in their studies in order to remain on a school team. It would encourage them to raise, or sustain their grades, further helping them succeed in life. Also, many colleges do not accept students under a B average. In order to further their career as a student-athlete, they will need to maintain their grades. This responsibility primarily falls on us.\\n\\nFor many student-athletes, it is highly unlikely that a career of professional sports awaits them. In order to succeed in the current, and extremely competitive job-market, they need to graduate from a university, or maintain decent grades throughout high school. Students that fall behind in their studies due to the athletics program may not be able to find a job after high school.\\n\\nThis is why I believe our school's policy should be changed. To benefit our students now, in college, and eventually in the job market. I believe we should enact this policy to preserve our student's, their grades, and their success in life. I believe we should hold academics above athletics.\",\n",
       " 'Teachers are the brain of school, they know everything and most of the time have solutions for every situation. Summer projects are projects that should help the students improve on their most needed parts of a subject. But a student designing these projects may lead to failure.\\xa0Teachers should be the ones who design summer projects because teachers can create projects better than students can, teachers know what student need to improve on, and some students wont finish the project before school starts. Others may say that its fun for students to create their own project and have their own spin on it. But most students wont end up turning it in before school starts.\\n\\nOne main way that students study is by doing projects before test and working on the topic there on. This means that teachers know how to create a project on topics that students need to work on. Teachers create projects better than students can and the ones teachers make will be better for the students. Students will either turn in lazy work that they rushed, or wont turn in at all. Students will procrastinate and once they start the project and have to start from scratch with no idea what their project needs to be about, they wont end up doing it.\\n\\nMost students dont know what topics that they need improvement on. So most students will do the project on an easy topic that they are more familiar with. But the teachers know what the students need to improve on. Teachers could deign the project around what needs improving. This will help the students who are struggling on certain spots of a subject and help them master it. For example when a student creates a project, mainly one over the summer, there going to want to get it done as fast as they can and then they will create a lazy project and will not get a good grade. But if a teacher deigns it, then students will more than likely be forced to create a good project and get a good grade on it.\\n\\nProcrastination is a big thing with students in high school and college. Students will procrastinate until the day before something is due. If students were the ones designing this project, they would procrastinate until the last day then not know where to even begin because they have no instructions. Students will end up proposing something bad or maybe dont even do it and start the school year off bad. But if students procrastinate until the last day and have instructions, then they will most likely end up doing it and most students will end up making a nice project.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Students, that are always on top of their work, will want to create their own projects. Students creating their own projects can be a learning experience if they want to become a teacher. Students will be able to put their own spin on the project. But its not all positives, other students that procrastinate a lot will have a hard time creating and starting a project. Or some students will do an easy project and then the project pretty much become useless.\\n\\nIn conclusion, teachers should be the ones who design summer projects because teachers can create projects better than students can, teachers know what student need to improve on, and some students wont finish the project before school starts. Most students who procrastinate wont have much of hard time if they have instructions and dont have to start from scratch. This will help students improve on what needs to be improved. Also some students might end up mastering the topics they need to improve. Others will think different and want to do the project by themselves, but thats not the best idea if they want to get a good grade.\\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0',\n",

In this essay, I will explore the positive effects that technology has on people's lives, analyze how it connects families separated by long distances, examine how it makes it easier for people to work remotely, explore how it can be used to form new friendships and learn about different cultures, and evaluate if technology is a valuable asset or not.\\n\\nOne of the most significant positive effects of technology is that it connects people from all over the world. Social media platforms, video conferencing, and messaging apps have made it easier for families and friends to stay in touch, regardless of the distance that separates them. This has brought families closer together, and it has made it possible for people to maintain relationships that might have been lost otherwise.\\n\\nAnother positive effect of technology is that it makes it easier for people to work remotely. With the rise of the internet and the availability of tools like video conferencing and collaboration software, people can now work from anywhere in the world. This has given people more flexibility in their work lives, and it has made it possible for companies to hire talent from all over the world.\\n\\nTechnology has also made it possible for people to form new friendships and learn about different cultures. Social media platforms and online communities have brought people together who might never have met otherwise. This has allowed people to learn about different cultures and ways of life, and it has made it possible for people to form new friendships that might have been impossible otherwise.\\n\\nWhile technology has many positive effects, it is not without its drawbacks. Some people argue that technology has made us more isolated and less connected to the world around us. Others argue that technology has made it easier for people to be lazy and less productive.\\n\\nDespite these concerns, I believe that technology is a valuable asset. It has brought people closer together, made it easier for people to work remotely, and has made it possible for people to learn about different cultures. While it is important to be mindful of the negative effects of technology, it is also important to recognize the many positive effects that it has had on our lives.\\n\\nIn conclusion, technology has had a significant impact on people's lives.

       " \"Hey, Mrs. Johnson! 😃\\n\\nOkay, so for this essay, I'm gonna talk about how growing up in a supportive or unsupportive family environment affects the decision-making process for teenagers. And then, I'll also discuss the importance of being yourself and the strength of mind needed to succeed in life. 🤔\\n\\nFirst off, let's talk about how growing up in a supportive family environment impacts decision making. When you have a supportive family, they're always there to encourage and help you make the right decisions. They provide a safe space for you to express your thoughts and feelings, and they're always willing to listen to what you have to say. This means that you're more likely to feel confident in your decision-making abilities, and you're less likely to feel pressured into doing things that you don't really want to do.\\n\\nOn the other hand, growing up in an unsupportive family environment can have the opposite effect. When you don't have a supportive family, it can be really hard to make decisions, especially when it comes to things that are important to you. You might feel like you're always walking on eggshells, worried that you'll say or do something wrong and get in trouble. This can lead to anxiety and stress, which can make it even harder to make decisions.\\n\\nNow, let's talk about the importance of being yourself and the strength of mind needed to succeed in life. Being yourself is super important because it means that you're being true to who you are. You're not trying to be someone you're not, which can lead to a lot of stress and unhappiness. When you're being yourself, you're more likely to feel confident and comfortable in your own skin, which can help you make better decisions.\\n\\nBut, it's not always easy to be yourself, especially when you're a teenager. There's a lot of pressure to fit in and be like everyone else, which can be really hard when you're different. You might feel like you don't belong, or that you're not good enough. But, the thing is, being different is actually a strength, not a weakness. It means\",\n",

       " 'Taking on a career at a young age can be an admirable pursuit, however, there are potential negatives associated with this decision that must be considered. Emotionally, children and young adults may face feelings of loneliness, exhaustion, resentment, and even burnout. These intensifying feelings can interfere with their ability to perform well in their chosen career, and can also lead to difficulty maintaining relationships and other commitments. Having to juggle multiple competing responsibilities can be mentally taxing, and lead to a sense of confusion and stress that can cause children and young adults to feel helpless in their career path. In some cases, adjusting to their role may come at the cost of important aspects of childhood, such as engaging with friends and family, playing sports, and finding time for hobbies. With this in mind, it is important to think carefully and realistically about taking on a career before making a serious or long-term commitment.',\n",

In contrast, an idle person is someone who does not engage in any meaningful activities and simply goes through the motions of life. In this essay, we will compare the qualities of these two types of people and examine their potential for success.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, an active person is someone who is driven and motivated to achieve their goals. They are always looking for ways to improve themselves and their lives, whether it's through education, work, or personal growth. This drive and motivation is what sets them apart from idle people and allows them to achieve success in their endeavors.\\n\\nOn the other hand, an idle person is someone who lacks direction and purpose. They may have goals, but they are not actively working towards them. Instead, they spend their time engaging in activities that do not contribute to their personal or professional development. This lack of drive and motivation is what holds them back and prevents them from achieving success in their lives.\\n\\nFurthermore, an active person is someone who is disciplined and organized. They plan their time effectively and prioritize their tasks, ensuring that they are making the most of their resources. This discipline and organization is what allows them to stay on track and achieve their goals, whereas an idle person may struggle to stay focused and organized.\\n\\nIn contrast, an idle person is someone who is disorganized and lacks discipline. They may have good intentions, but they do not have the necessary skills to plan and prioritize their time effectively. This lack of discipline and organization is what holds them back and prevents them from achieving success in their lives.\\n\\nFinally, an active person is someone who is open to new experiences and willing to take risks. They are not afraid to step outside of their comfort zone and try new things, even if it means failing. This willingness to take risks is what allows them to learn and grow, and ultimately achieve success in their endeavors.\\n\\nOn the other hand, an idle person is someone who is afraid of failure and unwilling to take risks.

       " \"Self-reliance is an important attribute to possess in order to be successful and lead a happy, fulfilling life. It involves having the common sense to solve a problem without expecting someone else to take the lead and responsibility. Experience matters as well, since having prior knowledge and learning from mistakes helps one make sound judgements and take meaningful actions. Independence also plays a role in becoming self-reliant. It is important to be able to make decisions for yourself and not always have to rely on somebody else’s opinion. \\n\\nHowever, there is an argument against relying too much on oneself. For instances, it can lead to a lack of collaboration in which people become too isolated and don't learn from the ideas of others. Taking advice from someone who is more experienced in a field and learning from them can be beneficial and even highlight areas where one was ignorant. \\n\\nIn conclusion, self-reliance is a necessary trait for leading a productive life but it should be balanced with taking constructive advice from others. Therefore, it is important to assess each situation and use wisdom in order to find the right amount of self-reliance to suit one’s needs.\",\n",

I thing the idea of adding 2 hours more to the schedule of the basic school is not a good idia, because students who are in the high school and have a job as a part-time or even a full time would decide to apply to a basic school.

       " \"Sometimes, you can be wrong. Most of the time people recognize it, so you go to other people for advice. Seeking multiple opinions is a good idea because you get more input, you can combine ideas to make one super plan, and if someone knows something you don't, then you can correct your idea and make it better.\\n\\nOne reason getting different opinions is a good idea is because you can get multiple second opinions. The best that could happen is that you and whoever you are talking with can add so many good opinions to your ideas that you could do something great with it, like design a great video game, or develop a new medicine, or maybe make a way to keep our soldiers safe in combat. If nobody gives any good opinions, you might just get laughed at. Not a lot of bad could come out of it.\\n\\nAnother reason second opinions are a good idea is because you can combine them into one super plan. Lets say you were playing a strategy video game called Total War-Three Kingdoms. You might want to do just a frontal assault on the castle walls, and take them by force, but your friend might point out that they have heavy\\n\\nPole arms up on the wall, a great anti-infantry unit. Your other friend says you need to take down the arrow towers along the wall to stop the enemy from peppering your troops with arrows as you assault the walls, and also need to use\\n\\nT\\n\\nrebuchets to destroy them. Then, you combine all the plans into one massive one- use the\\n\\nTrebuchets to both destroy the arrow towers and destroy the walls, taking out chunks of the wall so your troops can breach into the fortress, knocking the\\n\\nPole arms off the wall (effectively killing them), and taking out the arrow towers. Now that's good teamwork.\\n\\nThe final reason second opinions are better than only your own is if somebody knows information that you don't, they can provide it and you can revise whatever your idea or plan is. Say you are playing the same game (Total War-Three Kindoms), and this time you are defending on an open plane. You are maneuvering your troops into a defensive position that will be great for deflecting frontal attacks, when your ally tells you that they saw that the other team has a unit of the\\n\\nBlack Mountain Marauders\\n\\n(a very good anti-infantry duel-ax wielding unit with the special ability to be able to be deployed behind the enemy), but you and your ally notice that they aren't with the main enemy army. Your ally realizes that they must be hidden in the trees off to the left of your main army, and that if you hadn't realized it, they would have flanked your army and taken a massive toll. So, your ally decides that you hold off the main army, and he uses his archers and cavalry to rain hell on the hidden ax\\xa0warriors so they don't destroy you. How fun and violent.\\n\\nSo, second opinions are almost always better than one. Sure, you might know what you're doing, but ask trusted others what their take on the situation is. The reasons you do this is because more inputs produce better ideas, you can combine inputs into one super opinion, and others might know key information that you don't, so listen.\",\n",

Opposed to teachers, the students will find something effortless and easy to do. At that point it wouldnt be a challenge and they won't learn anything new. It wouldnt be a very difficult project either.

A teacher would give an example and teach you about the project so it won't be that hard on you anyways. students would know ahead of time if they have an issue with the teaching method or the project itself.

       " \"As an almost-graduate of high school, I have been exposed to various educational practices, and I believe that the policy of allowing parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online is a beneficial practice.\\n\\nOne of the primary reasons why I am in favor of this policy is because it encourages accountability. By allowing parents to monitor their children's academic progress, students will be more likely to take responsibility for their actions and strive to do their best in their coursework. This will lead to higher academic achievement, increased motivation, and improved study habits.\\n\\nAdditionally, parental involvement is crucial to a student's success in school. When parents are informed, they can help to identify areas where their child may be struggling and provide support and resources to help their child improve. This type of involvement also fosters a sense of partnership between the student, parent, and school, which can be incredibly beneficial to a student's academic journey.\\n\\nOn the other hand, some may argue that this policy can lead to helicopter parenting and an over-involvement of parents. While I understand this concern, I believe that it is ultimately up to the individual parent to determine how to best support their child's education. Schools can provide guidelines for appropriate parental involvement to ensure that it is beneficial and not detrimental to the child's academic success.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the policy of allowing parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online is a beneficial practice. It encourages accountability, promotes parental involvement, and fosters a sense of partnership between the student, parent, and school.

I believe that failure should be embraced as an inherent part of one\\'s journey towards success. I don\\'t believe that failure is something that should bring shame or guilt, but rather something that should be viewed as an opportunity for growth and development. Furthermore, I believe that failure can be used to further one\\'s learning, as we can always learn from our mistakes. Ultimately, failure should be accepted as an inevitable part of life, and the resilience to keep trying and trying again is the only true measure of success.',\n",

Here's my essay:\\n\\nWorking in a group is way better than working alone because, like, it's more fun and you get more done. First of all, when you're working with others, you can like, bounce ideas off each other and come up with way more creative stuff. Like, I was working on this science project with my buddy Alex and we came up with this totally cool experiment that we would have never thought of on our own. It was like, totally awesome.\\n\\nSecondly, working in a group is way more efficient than working alone. Like, when you're working with others, you can divide up the work and like, totally get it done way faster. My friend Emily and I were working on a history project and we divided it up between us, so we could like, finish it in half the time. It was like, so much easier.\\n\\nLastly, working in a group is like, way better for learning stuff. Like, when you're working with others, you can like, teach each other and learn from each other. My brother and I were working on a math project together and he was like, totally struggling with this one concept, so I was able to help him out and like, teach him how to do it. It was like, so cool.\\n\\nSo, like, yeah, working in a group is way better than working alone. It's more fun, more efficient, and way better for learning. So, like, next time you gotta do a project or something, don't be a loner like me, grab some friends and work together. It'll be like, totally awesome.\\n\\nThat's my essay, dude. I hope you like it. Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else. Peace out!\",\n",
       " 'The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a recent advancement in technology that can read emotions from facial expressions. Many people speculate where it could be used, from marketing to video games. Some might wonder whether it could be used in classrooms, which is a definitive \"No.\" FACS is not valuable to read student\\'s emotional expressions because the classroom shouldn\\'t include emotion, it has better uses elsewhere, and is invasive of privacy.\\n\\nEmotion shouldn\\'t dictate the lesson in schools. In the passage, Mr. D\\'Alto quotes, \" \\'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\\' Dr. Huang predicts. \\'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\\' \" (6). Everyone has walked into class one day, seen the lesson and then silently grumbled to themselves. This type of emotion shouldn\\'t change what the lesson is or how it is taught. The goal of teaching techniques is to effectively teach the broadest audience. This type of system would switch up the lesson for the few people who get confused easily, but then it hurts the majority\\'s learning experience. This is why the classroom shouldn\\'t include emotion.\\n\\nSystems such as FACS have better economical value elsewhere. In the passage, Mr. D\\'Alto says, \"For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.\" (6). This is one example of other industries that could utilize this type of technology. In the classroom, there is no economical value of being able to read the students emotions. Mr. D\\'Alto goes on to say, \"The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery.\" These are other industries that would love FACS-like technology. It\\'s a better investment to use FACS elsewhere other than the classroom.\\n\\nPrivacy is held dear by many. FACS can be invasive of this. Some students may wish to save their grief for a counselor, therapy, or simply a designated time to cry. FACS completely disrespects this fact and exposes an individual to everyone else. In the passage, D\\'Alto quotes, \" \\'Most human communication is nonverbal, uncluding emotional communication,\" notes Dr. Huang. \\'So computers need to understand that, too.\\' \" (6). This quote implies that computers are not yet able to comprehend whether or not the individual wishes to be \"scanned\", for a lack of a better term. This can be invasive. Until technology reaches a point until this changes, FACS should stay out of the classroom where students may not wish to have their emotions expressed involuntarily.\\n\\nIn conclusion, FACS is not only worthless, but harmful to the learning quality of students. This is because it has better uses elsewhere, is a breach of privacy and includes emotion into the classroom. FACS is, and may never be suitable for a classroom environment.',\n",

Driving is fun and is a helpful way, but imagine if you had to lower the amount of time you would spend in you car, it wouldnt be the end of the world the only negative effect of not using your car is taking more time to get there and exercising. A car releases fumes into the air which cuases air pollution, driving is one big reasons why we have global warming. According to researchers people in CarFree communities feel less stress without their cars, because having a car is a responsibilitybuying gas, not dentingscratching the car, and ofcourse keeping it clean. Driving is everywhere and has been here for awhile, driving has also sadly played a role in deaths across the nation, Driving under influence, foolishness, accidents and so on and so fourth. Maybe less driving isn't such a bad idea after all, there are already country that practice less car usage, even carfree days.\\n\\nWhen you have a car its a whole new world and responsiblitys you will have and you'll have to maintain it, but driving is not the only way of getting around, there is running and bicycles and walking which are all healthy options, maybe next time we you need to go to the local store you can take a bike or run there yourself and save gas and lessen airpollution, ofcourse one trip without a car won't save the world but its a start. This generation is closely tied to using cars and most of them don't think that when they use a car the effects it has on using a car. Cars have been a great invention but now their starting to become a lifestyle. One of the common results of driving is traffic it is seen all over the place and takes up time and cuases stress among drivers, less driving would clear up the roads and lessen stress for others and be an open opportunity for others to get healthy.\\n\\nCars make up around 50% of greenhouse gas in the United States and cars are a nasty contributer to Global warming the fumes of the cars go in the air and get trapped there and hurt the ozone layer, also gasoline a source we find underground which we are using more and more than we get and it is a nonrenewable resource, we break down mountains just to find this resource. Oil has caused political disputes and the loss of forest,enviorments and more. When a car is destroyed it is sent to the scrapyard which is a big land just for destroyed cars and it takes up space, and it once could have been a nice forest. Car usage also is the producer of smog, sometimes smog is so bad in country they would have to ban carusage for a number of days that means we are abusing cars just a little too much.\\n\\nLastly, CarFree is not new or scaring it actually is a rising trend country have done CarFree day and the culture is spreading across the areas, being outside without a car using a bike or skateboard is a nice calm and relaxing way to spend a day and thousands of people seem to think so too, statistics say in the US the amount of cars being bought is slowly declining and driving less and the amount of licenses being optained is too. In some states there bike sharing programs and communities without cars. CarFree communties are a great way to save enviorment, lessen air pollution and to connect the community together instead of passing by taking a walk and or taking a bike ride with someone you would want to be with, and instead of hearing the constant sound of a motor engine hear the sound of children at play. Lessening carusage can save money, less stress, and make you view things in a different perspective or even CarPool so others don't have to use their cars.\",\n",
       " \"Working in groups has become a common practice in many aspects of life, including education. The benefits of working together in groups are numerous, and they can have a significant impact on a student's academic and personal success. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of working together in groups, including increased motivation and productivity, collaborative problem-solving, and the development of people skills. I will also provide a list of ways that students can take advantage of these benefits when working on school projects and preparing for future careers.\\n\\nOne of the most significant benefits of working in groups is increased motivation and productivity. When students work together, they are more likely to be motivated to complete tasks because they know that their efforts will be recognized and appreciated by their peers. Additionally, working in groups can help students stay on track and complete tasks more efficiently because they can divide responsibilities and work together to achieve a common goal. This can be especially beneficial when working on school projects, where students must meet deadlines and work together to produce high-quality work.\\n\\nAnother benefit of working in groups is collaborative problem-solving. When students work together, they can share ideas and perspectives, which can lead to more creative and effective solutions to problems. This can be particularly helpful when working on complex projects or tasks that require a lot of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. By working together, students can learn from each other and develop the skills they need to succeed in the future.\\n\\nFinally, working in groups can help students develop people skills. When students work together, they must communicate effectively and work with others to achieve a common goal. This can help students learn how to listen to others, express their own ideas clearly, and work collaboratively with others. These skills are essential for success in the workplace and in other areas of life.\\n\\nIn order to take advantage of the benefits of working together in groups, students should actively seek out opportunities to work with others. This can include joining clubs or organizations, participating in group projects, or volunteering with community organizations. By working with others, students can develop the skills they need to succeed in the future and build strong, positive relationships with their peers.\\n\\nIn conclusion, working in groups has numerous benefits for students, including increased motivation and productivity, collaborative problem-solving, and the development of people skills. By actively seeking out opportunities to work with others, students can take advantage of these\",\n",
       " \"Dear TEACHER_NAME\\n\\nI think that you should follow policy 2 .Event though i love using my cell phone and do use it in class some times i think that they will become a huge distraction during school. First of all if kids get to use there phones during class breaks or when they are done with there work they will rush through it and do a bad job on it because they want to text or play on there cell phones. i know this will happen because i would do the same thing and also in the fifth grade. We got to go on the computers in the back of the classroom when we were don with our work and all of the kids would rush through there work and get Fs on there papers. After the teacher realised this she stopped letting us go on the computer when we were done. since she did this all the kids took more time on there work and got better grades. Also kids texting would distract the kids doing there work with all the vibrating and the ring tones because event if we wert allowed to have the sound on kids still have it on and say they forgot to turn it off and complain when the teacher took it away. Also if kids had to turn it off during work time they wouldn't and when there ring tone goes off during a test or quiz the teacher would half to take it away and the school would half to have a lot more phones and issue more detentions. Another thing is students would text students in other classes and if the other student forgot to turn there phone of, there would be one more phone taken away and the student who received the text would get two extended detention and probably get grounded by there parents. Also, do u like giving out all those detentions? If you do go with policy 1 and you get a lot more cell phones and get to stay after and hold a lot more detentions. These are all of the good reasons i think there should be no phones in school.\",\n",

Let me tell you, it\\'s a pretty controversial topic. \\n\\nFirst of all, let\\'s talk about the positive impacts.  Cell phones can be really helpful in the classroom!  Like, you can use them to look up information for projects or to access educational apps that can make learning more fun and interactive.  My teacher even uses them to poll us during lectures, which helps us stay engaged.  It\\'s like, \"Hey, what do you guys think about this?\" and we can just raise our phones and vote. \\n\\nBut,  there are also some negative impacts.  Like, sometimes students get distracted during class and start playing games or scrolling through social media.  It\\'s like, \"Ugh, why are you on your phone when you\\'re supposed to be learning?\"  And sometimes, teachers can get frustrated with students who are on their phones too much.  It\\'s like, \"Put your phone away and pay attention!\" \\n\\nSo,  compared to the positive impacts, the negative impacts are definitely more obvious.  But,  I think it\\'s important to find a balance.  Like, maybe we can use our phones for educational purposes, but also make sure we\\'re not getting distracted.  It\\'s like, \"Hey, let\\'s use our phones to learn, but also let\\'s not get too caught up in them.\" \\n\\nIn conclusion,  cell phones can be both helpful and distracting in the classroom.

       " 'Enthusiasm plays a major role in achieving success in all aspects of life. It is the foundation we use to make progress and move forward, even when faced with failure. As the old saying goes, “Where there’s a will there’s a way.” This is why it’s so important to stay passionate, no matter what life throws at us.\\n\\nWithout enthusiasm, we become easily discouraged. We may give up too easily in the face of challenges, or tell ourselves that things are too hard. This is why it’s important to remember that enthusiasm is a major influence on our motivation. It can make the difference between giving up and pushing through. As the great philosopher Aristotle once said, “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.” This emphasizes the importance of forming the right habits and having the right attitude in order to reach our goals.\\n\\nIn addition, being enthusiastic also boosts our confidence. It is said that enthusiasm is contagious and attracts the same level of enthusiasm from others. This means that having enthusiasm for something can make others more likely to help us achieve our goals. Furthermore, enthusiasm is an important tool to help us over come difficult times and stay positive. No matter what happens, knowing that we have the enthusiasm to keep moving forward is empowering.\\n\\nUltimately, enthusiasm is key to achieving our goals. We should never give up in the face of failure, and instead, embrace the challenges that come with pursuing success. Our enthusiasm is what will drive us to never give up and eventually reach our goals.',\n",

According to \"Orlando health article by Benjamin Kaplan\" it states that \"one out of 20 drivers use a phone once they get into their car\" this makes you over 4 times more likely to get into a car accident. The article talks about how you\\'re more likely to see teens in car accidents because of cell phones than adults now, this is because technology is made to grab the attention to teenagers, instead of putting their phones on do not disturb they rather risk their lives just to send a text.\\n\\nThere\\'s many ways people can try and stop texting and driving and stop family and close family members from risking their lives like in some states have the \"no hands law\" where you can\\'t have your phone in your hands which is a step forward to lowering car accident rates also in most places it\\'s illegal to text and drive. Another good things phones have on them is a \"do not disturb\" app that makes sure your phone doesn\\'t receive notifications, which will help with making you not check your phone because there isn\\'t really a point. Also before you pick up your phone you should think about the lives you are risking (pedestrians, whoever you are in the car with and whoever you get into the accident with) is it really worth checking your phone if there\\'s so many consequences?\\n\\nBeing on your phone while driving can lead to more outcomes than you may know. think about this, texting and diving then getting in a car accident will lead to insurance rates going up, may cause somebody to lose their life or cause permanent damage to your body. Depending on how bad the car accident is, it might lead to brain damage in the article \"all types of car injuries by FindLaw\" it talks about how some of the long term effects are back problems or spine injuries. a lot of people end up having bad sleep paralysis.

       " \"Group Work vs. Individual Work: Which is Better?\\n\\nAs an 8th grader, I have had my fair share of both group and individual work assignments. While some students might prefer to work alone, I believe that working with a group has more benefits than working alone. Here are some reasons why.\\n\\nFirstly, group work allows for a diversity of perspectives. When working in a group, you have access to a variety of ideas and opinions. This can lead to more creative and innovative solutions to problems. For example, if you were working on a science project, a group of students with different interests and strengths can come together to create a more comprehensive and well-rounded project.\\n\\nSecondly, group work promotes communication and collaboration. When working in a group, you have to learn how to communicate effectively with your peers. This can help you develop your public speaking and listening skills, which are essential in any career. Additionally, working in a group requires you to be a good team player, which means being willing to listen to others' ideas and work together towards a common goal.\\n\\nThirdly, group work can be more efficient than individual work. When working alone, it can be easy to get stuck on a problem or idea. But when working in a group, you can bounce ideas off of each other and build upon each other's thoughts. This can lead to a more productive and efficient work process. For instance, if you were working on a math project, a group of students could work together to solve a problem by building on each other's ideas.\\n\\nLastly, group work can be more enjoyable than individual work. When working alone, it can be easy to get bored or lose motivation. But when working in a group, you have the opportunity to interact with your peers and make new friends. This can make the work more enjoyable and rewarding. For example, if you were working on a history project, a group of students could work together to create a presentation that they could present to the class.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while some students might prefer to work alone, I believe that working with a group has more benefits than working alone. Group work allows for a diversity of perspectives, promotes communication and collaboration, can be more efficient, and is more enjoyable. So next time you have\",\n",
       " \"Making decisions is an inevitable part of life, and people often have different opinions on whether to make their own decisions or seek expert guidance. While seeking expert guidance can be helpful, there are also pros and cons to making decisions on your own.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of making your own decisions is that you have complete control over the outcome. You are free to make choices based on your own values, beliefs, and preferences, without the influence of external factors. This can lead to more personal satisfaction and fulfillment, as you are able to make decisions that align with your own goals and aspirations.\\n\\nHowever, there are also potential drawbacks to making decisions without seeking expert guidance. For example, you may not have access to all of the relevant information or perspectives, which could lead to a less well-informed decision. Additionally, your personal biases and beliefs may cloud your judgment, leading to a decision that is not in your best interest.\\n\\nThere are many examples of personal choices and decisions that people have made without expert advice. For example, many entrepreneurs start their own businesses without any formal training or experience in the field. While this can be risky, it can also lead to great success if the individual is able to identify a need in the market and develop a product or service that meets that need.\\n\\nAnother example is the decision to pursue a certain career path. Many people choose their careers based on their personal interests and passions, without seeking expert guidance on which careers are most likely to be successful or profitable. While this can lead to personal satisfaction, it may not always be the most practical or financially stable choice.\\n\\nDespite the potential drawbacks of making decisions without seeking expert guidance, there are many examples of individuals who have made successful choices based on their own intuition and instinct. For example, many famous artists and musicians have pursued their careers without any formal training or education, relying instead on their own creativity and passion.\\n\\nUltimately, the decision to make your own decisions or seek expert guidance is a personal one, and depends on the individual's values, beliefs, and goals. While seeking expert guidance can be helpful, there are also many examples of individuals who have made successful decisions based on their own intuition and instinct. It is important to consider the potential drawbacks and benefits of each approach, and to make a decision that aligns with your own goals and aspirations.\",\n",
       " \"Homework has long been a controversial topic in education, with some people arguing that it is an essential part of learning, while others believe it puts unnecessary stress on students. In my opinion, homework can be beneficial, but it should be used in moderation and with a clear purpose.\\n\\nOn the one hand, homework can help students reinforce what they have learned in class and prepare them for future lessons. For example, if a student is learning a new concept in math, doing homework problems can help them understand it better and build their problem-solving skills. Additionally, homework can teach students important life skills such as time management, responsibility, and self-discipline.\\n\\nOn the other hand, excessive homework can be counterproductive and lead to stress, which can negatively impact a student's mental and physical health. For instance, a student who is assigned too much homework may feel overwhelmed and anxious, leading to difficulty sleeping, headaches, and a decreased appetite. Furthermore, homework can take away from a student's free time, which is essential for relaxation and enjoyment.\\n\\nAnother issue with homework is that it can perpetuate inequality. Some students may have access to resources at home that others do not, such as a quiet study space, a computer, or a tutor. This can put students who do not have these resources at a disadvantage, leading to lower grades and decreased self-esteem.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while homework can be beneficial in moderation, it is important to ensure that it is used effectively and does not put unnecessary stress on students. Teachers should consider the amount of homework they are assigning and make sure it is relevant and engaging. Additionally, they should take steps to address any inequalities that may arise from homework, such as providing resources for students who need them. By striking a balance between homework and free time, students can benefit from the former while still having time to relax and enjoy their lives.\",\n",

These cars could be good for new drivers who don't know how to parrallel park. Teen drivers don't always get everything right the first couple of times so they will ahve their car to assitst them. This car could also accually be safer for mothers with multipule children. It may give her a chance to quickly distribute a bottle or pick up a toy a baby dropped. This also can still be dangerous because the driver won't be attentive.\\n\\nIn conculdion i believe there is no point of taking time to make a driverless car because You will always have to be attentive just like driving a regular car, and if you aren't and get into an accident it may end up being your own fault. The driver would have to be dependent on their car to avoid accidents, construction, wrong turns ,etc. Will you be able to trust you car with your life?\",\n",
       " \"When making an important choice, do people ever wonder if they should have asked more than that one person? Do they ever wonder if that one kid they asked had a biased opinion or if people in general have different opinions? When making a big, important choice, people, especially young adults and teens, should seek more than one person's opinion. People could have different past experience with lots of things and might help people decide when making an important choice. People should seek more than one opinion when making an important choice because people can have different past experience, people can be biased, and people can have different opinions about the subject matter.\\n\\nWhen making an important decision, lets say adopting a dog. People would want to ask multiple people if this would be a good idea or not. Adopting a dog is a big choice in someone's life and the person should seriously think this through. For example, lets say the person asks somebody who, in the past, had a dog who would always use the restroom in their house. That person probably would not recommend getting a dog. But then, if you ask a little kid who loves their dog very much and cuddles with it daily, they would recommend a dog. Now what if this individual had only asked the person with the bad dog? This person would now be denied their life time companion and emotional support. This exemplifies why people should ask multiple people before making an important choice. Now what if somebody wants to travel the world and they ask somebody about it. One person hated traveling, they were sick,got a bunch of stuff stolen from them,and got lost. This person hated traveling and would not recommend it to the person wanting to travel. This person had a bad past experience. But what if the person asked another person about traveling. This person absolutely loved traveling. They loved everything from the unique culture, to the flying in airplanes, to trying new things. This person had a good past experience with traveling and would recommend it to the person wanting to travel the world. This is another example of why getting multiple opinions before doing something because they could have different past experience. People with different past experience will have different opinions on certain matters.\\n\\nPeople have biased opinions about certain matters. Imagine if a person is trying to open a farm, but the person's best friend hates all farmers. The best friend has a biased opinion towards farmers and hates all of them. When the person asks the best friend if they should start a farm, naturally the best friend will say no. But if the person asks someone who loves animals and the outdoors, that person would say they should open a farm. If the person had only asked the biased best friend who hates farms, they would now not have a job and place to live that they are happy with. This is one example of why people should ask multiple people before making an important choice because people have biased opinions. What if a girl wants to try out for a football team. All of her friends say that is gross and annoying because girls can not play football. This is a biased opinion about girls who play football. While all of the girl's teachers and family say that is a great idea and the change the school needs. If she would not have asked her teachers, she wouldn't be on the team. That is why you should ask multiple people before making an important choice like starting a farm or joining the football team.\\n\\nPeople feel differently about lots of different things, whether they are small issues like shoes being ugly, or big issues like political opinions and whether schools should have dress code. What if someone wants to buy a Cadillac. Obviously, Cadillacs\\xa0are expensive and the person would ask somebody before spending their hard earned money on a Cadillac. If the person asks their best friend who thinks they are ugly if they should get a Cadillac, they would obviously say no. The best friend has an opinion on Cadillacs. If the person had asked somebody who thinks Cadillacs are amazing, they would say to buy it. This is an example of why asking multiple people before making a choice is good because they might have different opinions. If someone wants to open a donut\\xa0shop, but their uncle hates donuts. When they ask their uncle if they should open a donut shop, he will say no. He has an opinion of thinking donuts taste gross. But when they ask their sister who loves all desserts and will always support her sibling. She will say yes because she has an opinion of loving sweet foods and her siblings. This is an example of why people should ask more than one person before they do something. The student president might want to start a book club. A lot of students a do not like books because their teacher made them read a boring book three years ago and they have not liked books since then, they have an opinion on books from a long time ago. The teachers, on the other hand, love this idea because they think that students these days do not get enough reading time in and a book club would be a good idea. If the student president would not have asked the teachers if they liked the idea there would be no book club. This is why people should get multiple opinions before they do something because people have different opinions about things.\\n\\nWhen people ask for advice, they should always seek more than one opinion because the people they ask could have different past experience, be biased, or have different opinions about the matter. When asking for an opinion in something, always ask different people and different kinds of people. People can have different opinions about things and be biased. Asking biased people for an opinion on something is never good so that is why people ask more than one individual before they make an important choice. In conclusion, this is why people need to get multiple opinions before they make a big choice.\",\n",
       " 'From playing an instrument to battling in a game, from sports to journalistic\\xa0and\\xa0fantastical\\xa0writing, there are so many options of extracurricular activities. These clubs and teams can improve both the mental and physical health of students, affecting their daily lives positively and giving them another group of friends. A new rule that students must participate in at least one activity is an incredible opportunity to grow.\\n\\nHaving a place to relax and have fun in school can often be a struggle for students. While doing an extracurricular activity, students can release stress\\xa0and have fun doing something they love. In a club or team, students form a sort of \"family.\" They all share a passion or interest in the subject and get to know people they would not otherwise have met. Throughout the school day, students can build up confusion, worry or anger about projects and friendships. This gives them an opportunity to have fun doing something they enjoy.\\n\\nWhile these activities can simply be enjoyable, it also can improve health and affect students\\' day to day lives. Sports can keep students physically active and engaged. It has been scientifically proven that physical activity can improve a person\\'s happiness and reduce stress, although this also applies to any activity that is enjoyed by the student.\\xa0While participating in a club, students can ignore other thoughts and focus only on what is at hand. This is exactly what students tend to need after a long day of school.\\n\\nWith an outlet for energy and anxiety, students can focus better on their schoolwork and can also get the help they may need from their friends.\\n\\nMany people worry about participating in these activities, believing that students will not have enough time to focus on their studies. However, many of the students that already to extracurricular activities are active in multiple clubs. These students still manage to get their work done. Also, as this rule of participation would be school wide, teachers would likely lighten how much homework they give out. Finally, this prepares students for the future. They will have to learn to lead balanced lives as adults, so this will give them the opportunity to learn how to work efficiently and still have downtime.\\n\\nAll together, having an activity outside of school is a good idea for students as it improves health and grades and gives opportunities to have new friends. Enforcing this policy would be an interesting change and would lead to a happier and more efficient school environment.\\xa0',\n",
       " \" Failure is a natural part of life. It's something that everyone has experienced at some point in their lives. Whether it's failing a test, losing a job, or not achieving a goal, failure can be a difficult and discouraging experience. However, it's important to remember that failure is not the end of the road. Instead, it can be a valuable learning experience that helps us grow and become better versions of ourselves.\\n\\nOne of the most important things to remember about failure is that it's not something to be ashamed of. It's simply a part of the learning process. We all make mistakes and we all fail at times. It's important to embrace these experiences and use them as opportunities to learn and grow.\\n\\nOne of the ways that failure can be a valuable learning experience is by teaching us to be more resilient. When we fail, we learn to pick ourselves up and keep going. We learn to be more persistent and not to give up easily. This resilience is something that can be applied to many different areas of our lives, from our personal relationships to our careers.\\n\\nAnother way that failure can be a valuable learning experience is by helping us to identify areas where we need to improve. When we fail, we often have to take a closer look at what went wrong and why. This can help us to identify areas where we need to work harder or where we need to make changes in order to be more successful.\\n\\nFinally, failure can be a valuable learning experience because it teaches us to be more patient. When we fail, we often have to wait for the right opportunity to try again. This can be frustrating, but it can also be a valuable lesson in the importance of patience and persistence.\\n\\nIn conclusion, failure is a natural part of life. It's important to remember that it's not something to be ashamed of, but rather a valuable learning experience.

       " 'Hey, so for this essay, I had to research how having multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. And honestly, it\\'s pretty cool how it works. So, like, when you have multiple opinions, it\\'s like having different perspectives on something. And those perspectives can either support or go against your choice. It\\'s like, if you\\'re trying to decide where to go for spring break, and your friend thinks Hawaii is the best place ever, but your other friend is like, \"Ugh, don\\'t go there, it\\'s so crowded and hot.\" So, you\\'re like, \"Okay, well, maybe I shouldn\\'t go to Hawaii then.\" See what I mean?\\n\\nBut it\\'s not just about considering other people\\'s opinions. Having different opinions can also help you think of a better choice. Like, if you\\'re trying to decide what to wear to a party, and your sister is like, \"You should wear that cool new shirt you got,\" but your mom is like, \"You should wear something more conservative,\" you\\'re like, \"Hmm, maybe I should wear something in between.\" You know? So, it\\'s not just about picking one option, it\\'s about considering all the options and finding the best one.\\n\\nAnd then there\\'s advice from close ones. Like, if you\\'re trying to decide what college to go to, and your parents are like, \"You should go to state U,\" but your best friend is like, \"You should go to private U,\" you\\'re like, \"Okay, well, maybe I should consider both.\" It\\'s like, having people you trust give you their input can help you make a better decision.\\n\\nSo, in conclusion, having multiple opinions can really help you make a better choice. It\\'s like, having different perspectives and advice can help you think of something that you might not have thought of on your own. And it\\'s not just about picking one option, it\\'s about considering all the options and finding the best one. Cool, right?',\n",
       " 'Dear Principal,\\n\\nI am writing to share my thoughts on the idea of requiring all students to perform community service. I believe that community service is a valuable experience that can teach us important life skills and help us become responsible citizens.\\n\\nFirstly, community service can help us develop important skills such as leadership, teamwork, and communication. For example, when I volunteered at a local food bank, I had to work with a team of people to organize and distribute food. This experience taught me how to communicate effectively with others and work together to achieve a common goal.\\n\\nSecondly, community service can also help us develop empathy and compassion for others. When I helped out at a homeless shelter, I was able to meet people from different backgrounds and hear their stories. This experience helped me understand the challenges that people face and made me more grateful for what I have.\\n\\nLastly, community service can also be a fun and rewarding experience. When I participated in a beach cleanup, I enjoyed spending time with my friends while also making a positive impact on the environment.\\n\\nHowever, I understand that some students may feel that community service takes too much time away from their other activities. While it is important to balance our commitments, I believe that community service is a valuable experience that should be a priority for all students.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that all students should be required to perform community service. This experience can help us develop important skills, empathy, and compassion for others, and can also be a fun and rewarding experience. I hope that you will consider implementing this requirement at our school.\\n\\nThank you for your time.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]',\n",
       " \"I think summer projects should be a mix of both teacher-designed and student-designed.\\n\\nTeacher-designed projects can be beneficial because they can help students reinforce what they learned during the school year and prepare for the upcoming year. For example, a teacher might assign a project that has students create a multimedia presentation on a historical event, which can help them remember key dates and events, while also developing their technology skills. Additionally, teacher-designed projects can help ensure that students are learning what they need to know to succeed in the next grade level.\\n\\nOn the other hand, student-designed projects can be beneficial because they allow students to explore their interests and passions. For example, a student who loves photography might design a project where they take pictures of different types of flowers and research their meanings. This allows students to learn through hands-on experiences and develop their critical thinking and problem-solving skills.\\n\\nHaving a mix of both teacher-designed and student-designed projects can also help students develop a sense of ownership over their learning. When students have a say in what they are learning, they are more likely to be engaged and motivated. Additionally, this approach can help students develop important skills such as time management and self-directed learning, which are essential for success in college and the workforce.\\n\\nIn conclusion, a mix of teacher-designed and student-designed summer projects can provide students with a well-rounded learning experience that prepares them for the next school year while also allowing them to explore their interests and develop important skills.\\n\\nHowever, it's important to note that, these projects should be age appropriate and should not over burden the students, also the teachers should provide clear guidelines and support throughout the process to ensure that students are able to complete the projects successfully.\",\n",
       " \" Some schools have a program that pairs older students with younger ones to assist them with homework or classwork. This program has numerous benefits for both the older and younger students. In this essay, I will outline three ways this program is helpful for both groups.\\n\\nFirstly, the younger students will greatly benefit from the program as they will have access to the knowledge and experience of the older students. This will allow them to receive the help they need to succeed academically. As the program grows in popularity, students can form groups and work on different projects together, further enhancing their learning experience.\\n\\nSecondly, this program can be very beneficial for students who are struggling academically. It provides an opportunity for them to receive additional support and guidance from their peers. Students can also donate materials such as binders, books, folders, crayons, pencils, pens, and paper to help their younger peers. Even the students themselves can start their own fundraiser by selling food and raising money to support the program.\\n\\nLastly, this program is beneficial for the community as a whole. It fosters a sense of community and collaboration among students, which can have a positive impact on their overall well-being. This program is important for both students and adults, as it promotes academic success and personal growth.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the program that pairs older students with younger ones is extremely beneficial for both groups.

       " 'Hey, Mrs. Johnson! Here\\'s my essay on Thomas Jefferson and his beliefs about working hard and serving each other with respect.\\n\\nSo, I learned that Thomas Jefferson was like, super smart and stuff. He was born in Virginia in 1743 and grew up to be a lawyer and politician. He even wrote the Declaration of Independence! But what\\'s really cool is that he believed in working hard and coming together to help each other out.\\n\\nAccording to my research, Jefferson thought that everyone should have the opportunity to succeed, no matter where they came from. He believed that hard work and determination could take you far, and he was all about giving people a fair chance. Like, he even started a school for poor kids so they could get an education and make something of themselves.\\n\\nBut here\\'s the thing, Mrs. Johnson. Jefferson didn\\'t just stop at education. He thought it was important to treat others with respect and kindness, no matter their background or beliefs. He believed that we should all come together and help each other out, even if we don\\'t always see eye to eye.\\n\\nNow, I know some people might be like, \"But Jefferson owned slaves, so he wasn\\'t really a good guy.\" And yeah, that\\'s true. But what I learned is that he didn\\'t always act on his beliefs, and that\\'s not okay. He had a lot of growing up to do, and we can learn from his mistakes.\\n\\nSo, how does this apply to present day? Well, I think it\\'s super important to remember that everyone has their own struggles and challenges. We shouldn\\'t judge people based on where they come from or what they believe in. Instead, we should try to understand each other and work together to make the world a better place.\\n\\nLike, I know some people might have different opinions than me, but that doesn\\'t mean they\\'re not worth listening to. We should all come together and respect each other\\'s viewpoints, even if we don\\'t always agree. And who knows, maybe we can learn something new from each other!\\n\\nAnyway, that\\'s my essay.

       " 'Many people still believe that the Face on Mars is created by aliens. Some say it\\'s to hard to really know what the object really is. Although many people disbelieve this is not a face, there is many places out west that look like this, and the cameras we used for this mission are to clear, and catch the smallest details, to be counted as incorrect. I believe that the Face, is only a landmark.\\n\\nBased on the story, Unmasking the Face on Mars, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadow that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\" When this picture was showed to the world, many people thought it looked like a face, just like many scientst. but the people from NASA called it a \"huge rock formation... which resembles a human head...\" formed by shadows, giving it an ilusion of a face. Many people still doubted this, and wanted to believe it was a face. I can see how it looks like it has eyes, a nose, and a mouth, but just because it looks like somthing, it doesn\\'t mean it is that.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong. I do believe that it looks like a person, or alien, but many things look like something else, and it doesn\\'t mean thats what they are, because of looks. The story, Unmasking the Face on Mars states, \"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west.\" So based on this sentence, it could be a formation like out west. it has the same height as one in Idaho. It could have a different face then ones on Earth, but I highly doubt it is an alien.\\n\\nThe first, and second image on Mars look like faces, and appear to have all the needs to be a face. The second image wasn\\'t really clear, and many people are right. Some people say, \"the face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it is winter in April \\'98-a cloudy time of yer on the Red Planet. Perhaps alien marking were hidden by haze.\" This could be true. I do believe that if there was anything little, or hard to see, it couldn\\'t be found when it was really cloudy outside, and the picture wasn\\'t taken clearly.\\n\\nEven though you couldn\\'t see what was there, on the second picture, we did take another one. I do believe that some things could have been hidden, but they would have been found, with the third picture. Based on the text, \"if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" you would be able to see anything. So there was nothing there. the only thing that was there, ws a land formation, just like Earth has. We weren\\'t able to find anything that would make the formation, considered to be some type of alien creation.\\n\\nBased on research, and facts from, \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" I believe that the Face, was actually just a land formation. For those who believe it was an alien, then you might be right, but from evidence, I think that it is just a cool and unique formation. The first images were unclear, to tell, but the thir image, was very clear, and us people from NASA, discovered that it wasn\\'t an alien, but just a formation, like a butte or mesa. The Face, had shadows that made it look like eyes, a nose, and a mouth, but it actually wasn\\'t. ',\n",

       " \"Dear Mr. President,\\n\\nAfter reading informative essays on the Electoral College, i believe the Electoral College should be retired and change the election to popular vote during the election of our United States' president.\\n\\nAlthough the Electoral College was established by the founding fathers in the Constitution (What is the Electoral College?, 1) it can cause something known as the disaster factor. This happened back in 1960 and 2000. John F. Kennedy was almost replaced by the Democratic electors who nearly succeeded opposing him (The Indefensible Electoral College, 3).\\n\\nAnother worry factor of the electoral vote is a tie. This could mean putting the election of the president into the hands of the Senate. This also makes Wyoming, who has one representative, have equal say with a state like California, who has fifty-five represenatives (The Indefensible Electoral College, 12). This allows for the opposite of the will of the people. Isn't that what we want? The will of the people.\\n\\nThe winner-take-all system in every state also makes the electoral college unfair to voters (The Indefensible Electoral College, 13). Putting the decision of our US president in the hands of a few voters in one state while others don't even get to see the candidates is absolutely unjust.\\n\\nAlthough, there are a few reasons we should keep the electoral college. With the electoral college there is always a certainty of outcome (In Defense of the Electoral College, 18). This means that a candidate's electoral college votes exceeds popular vote. This cuts out the factor of a lanslide electoral vote in only one state; keeping in line the will of the people.\\n\\nThe Electoral College process of voting during election time is old, outdated, and unfair to our voting population. As a United States citizen, i think we should leave the election of our president up to popular vote; everyone will have a say and it takes out al the complications of electoral votes and representatives and most imporatantly takes the exact decisions of the will of the people.\\n\\nThank you for your time and taking my claims into consideration.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nAimee Iorio       \\xa0    \",\n",

You'll never know if you meet new people that you've never seen before or heard before and they turn nice and you guys could be good friends. I had friends from my soccer team and they were in my school that I didn't even knew that they were in my school so I started to hang out with them in school and after soccer practice. It's basically about friendship because if someone wants to meet more and new people they should go try out something they like and try it out with their future friends and enjoy together. For example, I keep meeting more and more people because of after school activities\\xa0or someone in school that is friends with their friends.

       " '\"You should block her on everything and never talk to her again\", Generic_Name told Generic_Name. Furiously in anger, Generic_Name did as Generic_Name told her what was best to do and blocked Generic_Name, Generic_Name and Generic_Name had been best friends, but Generic_Name had just found out that Generic_Name wasn\\'t taking her to Florida for spring break which they had planned on since forever. The next day came and while Generic_Name was headed to class Generic_Name came up to her, \"Hey, it says that you blocked me I was\", Generic_Name stared at her full with rage and walked off before Generic_Name could finish. Generic_Name knew Generic_Name was coming up to her to ask for forgiveness but Generic_Name wasn\\'t going to forgive her, nor talk to her. As days went on Generic_Name ignored Generic_Name, but Generic_Name didn\\'t even comprehend what she had done wrong for this to happen. \"I don\\'t know why she\\'s ignoring me and I really want to know what I did wrong so I could fix it, so could you guys go talk to her for me?\" Generic_Name asked Generic_Name and Generic_Name,\\xa0\"Sure we\\'ll go ask her\",they walked towards Generic_Name, \"Hey Generic_Name\" Generic_Name said, \"how have you\\'ve been?\" \"Awful\", Generic_Name answered. Generic_Name glanced at Generic_Name, \"Oh why is that?\\'\\' Generic_Name finally asked, \"Generic_Name isn\\'t taking me to Florida, and instead is taking Generic_Name when in reality Generic_Name and I have been planning on going to Florida since forever!\" Generic_Name exclaimed. \"Oh is this why you\\'ve been ignoring her?\" Generic_Name asked while sitting besides Generic_Name, \"Yes and it seems as if she doesn\\'t even care\", Generic_Name answered. \"Well maybe it\\'s because you\\'ve been ignoring her, in reality she doesn\\'t know what she did wrong, instead of ignoring her you should talk it out with her\",Generic_Name advised Generic_Name, the two girls got up and went back where Generic_Name was, while Generic_Name sat there she realized that she was the one who messed up. Instead of ignoring Generic_Name she should\\'ve discussed the situation with her, she realized that Generic_Name\\'s advice wasn\\'t the best and she should\\'ve went to more people for advice. It is best when you ask multiple people for advice rather than only asking one because it gives you multiple choices, same situations, and an overview on the situation\\n\\nFirst off, a benefit in asking multiple people for advice is them giving you a variety of choices to pick from. For instance, Generic_Name had snuck out and while he was out having a fun time, he fell from a high distance and broke his arm. He had to come up with a way to tell his parents without telling them what really happened so he went to his friends for advice, they gave him various situations now he could now choose because he knew that if one didn\\'t work the other one had too. This is useful because if he had just asked one of his friends their plan could\\'ve backfired. Another example, Generic_Name didn\\'t want to go out, so she asked her friends what to do so she could convince her parents not to take her out. Her friends came up with a bunch of ideas,now she could do all of them until her parents let her stay home. Unlike if she would\\'ve asked one person, and they reply with say you don\\'t feel good her parents still would\\'ve taken her because it isn\\'t creative as the others. So when asking more people for advice it gives you multiple options to choose from.\\n\\nNext, asking multiple people lets you find others that have gone through the same situation as you and figure what is best to do. For example, Generic_Name had just gotten into an argument with her friend and didn\\'t know what to do, when she asked her friend Generic_Name for advice she told her that she had once gotten into an argument with the same person as Generic_Name so she let her know what to do. With that advice Generic_Name\\'s problem was now solved. Another case, in where this happened is when Generic_Name got dumped by her boyfriend she was overcome with sadness, but she didn\\'t want to stay like this she knew a lot of her friends had been through this exact situation she went to them for advice they gave her amazing advice that helped her overcome her dilemma. Now if she had gone with someone that hadn\\'t gone through a breakup their advice wouldn\\'t have been as effective. So going for multiple people for advice lets you meet people that have gone through the same situation.\\n\\nFinally, when going to multiple people for advice they will most often\\xa0give you the same ideas and it gives you an overview of what you need to do, especially if you\\'re not controlled at the time you won\\'t do anything you shouldn\\'t. For instance, Generic_Name had found out her friend had been telling everyone secrets Generic_Name trusted her with. She went to go ask for advice and everyone had maintained the concept of talking to her and trying to resolve what had happened. Even though she was furious at how her friend had done that to her she didn\\'t go around doing the same thing she had done to her because her outlook on this situation was trying to resolve the problem. Another time, is when Generic_Name was failing one of his classes and he had a big test that would count as half of his grade he didn\\'t know what to do because if he failed this test he was definitely going to fail this class. Going to ask his friends they told him to study and get help from his teacher, so that is what he did instead of cheating since at the time it felt like the only way to get out of this problem but now his overlook on this situation was studying and getting help on what he needed to get better at to pass his test. So when asking multiple people for advice it gives you an overview on the sitution and helps you control yourself.\\n\\nGeneric_Name went to go ask her friends on what to do with Generic_Name, as she had found out she was taking Generic_Name with her to Florida instead of her which had been the original plan. \"Talk to her and check if she is actually taking Generic_Name before anything\", Generic_Name said. \"Don\\'t do anything you\\'ll regret later so just try to resolve it\", Generic_Name said, everyone she had asked kept the same concept of making sure she was taking Generic_Name and talking to her and trying to resolve the problem. Generic_Name resolved it,that\\'s why taking advice from multiple people is best.   \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0',\n",
       " \"In today's fast-paced world, it is easy to believe that having a positive attitude is all that is needed to achieve success in life. However, I argue that a hard-working attitude is more useful than a positive attitude in achieving success in life. While having a positive attitude can certainly help, it is not enough on its own.\\n\\nFirstly, a hard-working attitude is essential for success in life. It is the driving force behind achieving goals and achieving success. Without hard work, success will always be out of reach. A positive attitude can help motivate and inspire individuals to work hard, but it is ultimately the effort and dedication that leads to success.\\n\\nSecondly, a hard-working attitude is more reliable than a positive attitude. A positive attitude can be fleeting and easily swayed by external factors, such as setbacks or disappointments. On the other hand, a hard-working attitude is a consistent and unwavering commitment to achieving one's goals. It is not affected by external factors and remains steadfast in the face of adversity.\\n\\nLastly, a hard-working attitude is more practical than a positive attitude. It is grounded in reality and takes into account the challenges and obstacles that must be overcome to achieve success. A positive attitude can be unrealistic and fail to account for the hard work and dedication required to achieve success.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while a positive attitude can certainly help, it is not enough on its own to achieve success in life. A hard-working attitude is more useful and reliable in achieving success. It is the driving force behind achieving goals and is not affected by external factors. A hard-working attitude is grounded in reality and takes into account the challenges and obstacles that must be overcome to achieve success.\",\n",
       " 'Setting high goals versus low goals has been a topic of debate for years. While some people believe that setting high goals leads to success, others argue that low goals are more realistic and achievable. In this essay, I will explore the pros and cons of setting high goals and argue that setting high goals is beneficial.\\n\\nFirstly, setting high goals can lead to a greater sense of accomplishment. When you set high goals for yourself, you are challenging yourself to achieve something that may seem difficult or impossible. When you finally reach that goal, you feel a sense of pride and accomplishment that you may not have felt if you had set a lower goal. This sense of accomplishment can motivate you to set even higher goals in the future, leading to a cycle of continuous improvement.\\n\\nSecondly, setting high goals can help you push yourself out of your comfort zone. When you set high goals, you are forcing yourself to work harder and be more disciplined. This can lead to personal growth and development, as you learn new skills and overcome challenges that you may not have faced if you had set lower goals. Additionally, pushing yourself out of your comfort zone can lead to new opportunities and experiences that you may not have had if you had stayed within your comfort zone.\\n\\nHowever, there are some potential downsides to setting high goals. One potential downside is that setting high goals can lead to feelings of failure and disappointment if you do not achieve them. This can be demotivating and may cause you to give up on your goals entirely. Additionally, setting high goals can be stressful and may lead to burnout if you are not able to maintain the necessary level of discipline and focus.\\n\\nIn conclusion, setting high goals can be beneficial in many ways. It can lead to a greater sense of accomplishment, help you push yourself out of your comfort zone, and lead to personal growth and development. While there are some potential downsides to setting high goals, the benefits often outweigh the risks. Therefore, I recommend that you set high goals for yourself and work hard to achieve them.',\n",
       " 'Graduating high school in three or four years is a topic that has been debated for many years. While some people argue that graduating in three years is better because it allows for more free time and opportunities for life activities, others argue that graduating in four years provides a higher quality of education and more opportunities for elective courses. In this essay, I will explore the pros and cons of graduating high school in three or four years and argue in favor of graduating in four years.\\n\\nGraduating in three years allows for more free time and opportunities for life activities. Many people argue that high school is just a stepping stone to adulthood, and that students should be able to enjoy their youth while they can. Graduating in three years would allow students to take more time off from school to travel, pursue hobbies, and spend time with family and friends. Additionally, graduating in three years would allow students to start college or enter the workforce sooner, which could lead to more job opportunities and higher salaries in the long run.\\n\\nHowever, graduating in three years could also have negative consequences. First, students may not be fully prepared for the rigors of college or the workforce. Many colleges and employers require a certain level of knowledge and skills that may not be acquired in three years. Additionally, graduating in three years may limit the number of elective courses that students can take, which could limit their opportunities for personal growth and exploration.\\n\\nOn the other hand, graduating in four years provides a higher quality of education and more opportunities for elective courses. Graduating in four years allows students to take more elective courses, which can lead to a more well-rounded education. Additionally, graduating in four years provides more time for students to prepare for college or the workforce. This extra time can help students develop the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in their chosen field.\\n\\nFurthermore, graduating in four years can also lead to more job opportunities and higher salaries in the long run. Many employers prefer candidates who have completed a four-year degree, as it shows a higher level of dedication and commitment to their education. Additionally, graduating in four years can lead to more job opportunities and higher salaries in the long run, as it can help students stand out in a competitive job market.\\n\\nIn conclusion, graduating high school in',\n",
       " 'In recent years, the number of cars on the road has increased rapidly, causing traffic congestion, pollution, and other problems. Therefore, limiting car usage can provide numerous advantages to individuals, communities, and the planet.\\n\\nOne of the main benefits of reducing car usage is reducing traffic congestion. When too many cars are on the road, it causes delays in travel time, which can be frustrating for drivers and passengers. Moreover, traffic congestion contributes to air pollution, as cars emit harmful gases that can lead to health problems.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is reducing air pollution. Cars emit pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter, which can have a negative impact on air quality. This can lead to respiratory problems, heart disease, and other health issues. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can reduce the amount of pollutants released into the atmosphere.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can also improve public transportation. When there are fewer cars on the road, public transportation can move more efficiently, helping people get to their destinations faster. Additionally, public transportation is often more affordable than owning and maintaining a car, which can save people money.\\n\\nFinally, limiting car usage can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Cars contribute to climate change by emitting carbon dioxide, which is a greenhouse gas. By reducing car usage, we can reduce our carbon footprint and help mitigate the effects of climate change.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage can provide numerous advantages to individuals, communities, and the planet. It can reduce traffic congestion, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions, while also improving public transportation. Therefore, we should all consider using alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transportation, whenever possible. Let us work together to create a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable future.',\n",

I think you should join it because there is so many sights that we can see on our ways across oceans on boat trips, it's an opportunity to work hard, and it's fun.\\n\\nThe first reason I think you would enjoy this program is because there is so many sights to be seen. I saw many sights. I saw the excavated castle in Crete and marvled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. I also, took a ride on a Gondola in Vencie, Italy a city with streets of water. Like I said these are all wonderfull sights you could see. There is one sight I think was the most special and that was the Acropolis in Greece. Europe and China are a couple other sights. The boat trips do take a while though. For example, it took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States, and a month to get to China. These are many sights that make this program super enteresting and fun.\\n\\nThe next reason I think you should join this program is because it's an opportunity to work hard and show others what we can do. There are many opportunities to do, expecially if you are on the cattle boat. Some of the things to do are, caring for animals, and makeing sure they have been fed and watered, pullying bags of oates and bales of hay from the lower holds of the ship to the upper, and cleaning the stalls. These many things were hard work.\\n\\ncleaning the stalls was every night and the animals had to be checked daily and nightly to make sure none of them were hurt and fed and watered properly. All of these responsabillities are hard work.\\n\\nJust because there's hard work dosen't mean theres not any fun, because there is. once the animals and cargo are all dropped off there is time to have fun on board, The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed. Tabletennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time. As I said before there are many things to do fun it's not always just seriousness. There is time to goof around and have fun too .\\n\\nLike I had said before, there are many reasons to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. You should join this program because there are so many sights to see on boat trips, it's an opportunity to work hard, and there's time to have fun. I hope this makes you want to join this program because it's a good time to shine. Well, not really shine but, you know what I mean.\",\n",
       " \"Would you like it if your school principal would force you to do an extracurricular activity even though you dont want to. Im sure most students wouldnt mind staying after for an extracurricular activity, but for some students it could bother them, or could mess up how they are during classes because they haven't done their homeowrk because they weren't home to do it, or sometimes maybe at home because some students have to be home with their little siblings or helping their parrents at home ,and sometimes they can't becuase they are a school doing an activity.\\n\\nWould you be upset if you have to stay for an extra activity? I certenly would be upset, and heres why. If my principal made me stay after school for an extra activity I would be upset beacuse I have to go home and take care of my little brother and little cousin. Also I have to help my mom around the house and if I stay after I can't help as much because i will be late and i will be at school do activitys at school, and im sure im not the only person that has to deal with that, and it can be very hard to work on both things at the same time.\\n\\nIf I were to stay afterschool to do activitys I feel like it would mess me up in some classes because i need to be doing homework or staying afterschool for a class, but if we don't have the extra activity I think we will be fine in our classes and our grades will be good. Another problem is that a lot of kids will be staying after school, and it could stress teachers out and might not want to help to stay afterschool.\",\n",
       " \"Extracurricular activities, are a great way to find an interest you may have. Some activitie's can be outdoor's, like the hiking club, or the soccer club. These club's help get kids outside, and doing something that they love, with their friend's. Other club's, like the robotic's,video game,or board game\\xa0club's are great for kid's who prefer to be indoor's. They can help those kids make friend's,become smarter,and most importantly have fun.\\n\\nI believe, that student's should not participate in extracurricular activities if they do not want to. For some kid's who have activities out of school, they might have are hard time getting to their club's. It might put more stress on them, because they would first, go to their after school club. Then, go straight to what they do after school. Finally, they would make it home at a really late hour, then realizing that they did not have any time to do their homework. They might walk into school, exhausted, and probably not as efficient. Their grade's could drop, and possibly the school's average.\\n\\nMy next reason is, that I believe it might effect the kid's that want to be their. Some kid's who signed up have waited to do this for a while. When you bring in a kid that does not want to be their, he may cause a ruckus. It might make the kid that want's to be their annoyed, and sick of his nonsense. It would start to make the kid that want's to be their might have less fun. With all of that, it could make no kid's want to be their, and everybody wishing they could just go home.\\n\\nMy final reason is the right of choice. Everybody has the right to do something that they want. In my opinion, you cannot just force someone, to do something that they don't want to do. If they want to join a club at school, and have fun with their friend's,then that is great. If they want to stick with their out of school activities, or no activity that is all good. We cannot force someone to have fun.\\n\\nI loved all of my club's at my school. I remember, in elementary school doing taek won do with my friend's was awesome. It seemed at my school everybody loved their club's that they were in. I believe, it was because it was our choice. The school did not force us to do a club, and that was the beauty of it. Everyone did what they wanted to do. Being with people with my same interest, helped me make new friend's. It could do that with kid's all over the country. But at the end of the day, it should always be the students choice on what they want to do.\",\n",
       " 'In the modern technological world, it is hard to ignore the potentially negative impact that technology has had on our lives. While technology has revolutionized how we live, the side effects cannot be overlooked. One such side effect is that people are slowly losing their ability to think for themselves. \\n\\nThe exponential growth of technology over the past decade has meant that technology is now everywhere. Instead of relying on our own problem-solving abilities, we are increasingly relying on technology to do things for us. As an example, the many online banking sites and financial calculators available have become the norm, as opposed to manually calculating and budgeting ourselves. This has led to many people becoming dependent on technology as a mental crutch, and caused us to lose our ability to think independently.\\n\\nAnother way that technology has negatively impacted our lives is how it has become both an addiction and a distraction. With the ability to access the internet and social media from wherever we are, a large portion of our days are now spent aimlessly browsing. This addiction has significantly reduced the amount of time that we are spending thinking and reasoning for ourselves. \\n\\nTechnology has undoubtedly become an integral part of our way of life. However, it is important to recognize the negative effects that it can have, as this may lead to us losing the ability to think for ourselves and be self-reliant. If we are not careful, our current generation and future generations may suffer because of it.',\n",
       " 'Summer, as known throughout the whole world, is for relaxation. Now when it comes to students, summer is a school free zone, mentally and physically. Though some teachers believe it is a smart idea to give the students projects or summer reading so they wouldn\\'t forget some of the school work and already have a review over the summer when they come back. That is always expected when schools start back, though not all the students that were assigned to do the assignments did them because they either didn\\'t understand the task correctly or they just wanted to enjoy summer and not think about any school work. That causes both the students and the teachers to be irritated and dissapointed. However, that could be changed by just one small upgrade.\\n\\nFor years, school systems and teachers have been assigning students lessons that they will either never use in the real life or lessons the students don\\'t understand or don\\'t want to learn because the topics don\\'t interest them. Many studies have shown the peak of the students grades is when they are being taught about modern day conflicts or societies, or just topics that interest them. That shows the students want to learn about what relates to them or something they actually want to learn about. Also, some students want to actually earn their grade. As surprising as it is, students want to do their work, because they want to be happy when they get the \"A\" and say that they deserved it because they worked hard on the assignment. Though not all of them can do that because not all of them might understand the assignment. Here, is where the upgrading comes in handy.\\n\\nSchool systems need to find new ways of education and renew all of the \"traditional\" ways of teaching. The systems need to understand that these generations are becoming more complicated to teach because of all the new modern trends and technologies. It is becoming easier for the students to understand the lessons from their peers and not the teachers, because it is becoming more difficult each day for the teachers to connect with their students. That is usually either because of social distractions or lack of good communication between the teacher and their students. Though if the teachers and the systems started renovating and thinking about new ways such as: letting the students choose their own topics of what they want to do for summer projects. They can just start from the summer projects, start it off small and see how much of an effect that will make and if it comes out with a pretty positive effect then take action during the actual school months.\\n\\nEvery student does not wish or even want to keep having bad grades in school. Especially because of minor things or because they think they are not smart enough to succeed like their peers. Taking effect in letting students choose what they want to do for their summr projects will make a huge imapct on how the students will learn when they go back to school. That will also affect how the school systems view students learning and will see that it\\'s the best choice to start upgrading their teaching system to the more modern ways. Students will want to actually do their assingments because they will know what they are do it and actually understand it. They will even enjoy what they are doing because they know they will do good because they worked hard on what they are doing.\\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0',\n",
       " 'Most people like to have the opportunity to do things their own way. Students should be allowed to design their own summer projects. Although it may be customary for teachers to design educational programs of this sort, it can allow students to display their creativity and ability to be independent when it comes to their own education. Students designing their own summer projects can get them to be more interested in what they should be learning, which can result in them being more motivated and enthusiastic\\xa0for the upcoming school year.\\n\\nAllowing students to design their own summer projects can give them more creative freedom. Some students enjoy making their own study guides and presentations because it allows them to contribute their talents and hobbies\\xa0to make learning more enjoyable for them. When students have the ability to create something however they want, they are likely to be more determined in doing the task. It also gives students a break from the repetitive styles of teaching they are accustomed to at school.\\n\\nThe responsibility of designing a summer project can help students acknowledge their need to become more independent. If students realize the importance of completing their summer projects on their own, it can give them the push to strive for more by themselves. Some students may be used to getting answers handed to them, but having to do it on their own\\xa0can inspire a new sense of desire and maturity.\\n\\nTeachers are more accustomed to creating things like this, so they would have a more knowledge on what is and is not important for a student to be creating and learning by themselves. It could be easier on the students and teachers if teachers assigned an outline on what they expected to be learned by students over summer. However, teachers fail to consider there are alternative ways to learning that help can students compared to how they would expect it to be taught. This will give students the opportunity to explore new ways of learning independently. This can also benefit teachers by seeing where their students are individually and how they can handle projects like this by themselves.\\n\\nStudents designing their own summer projects can improve students love for education. Students will be able to experience a new kind of independence. Furthermore, since students are the ones expected to complete this summer project, it would only be fair if they were allowed to design it in a way that benefits them.\\xa0',\n",
       " ' It is important for individuals to take responsibility for their actions and decisions, and as such, there are many challenges that we must overcome to fulfill these responsibilities. A city council is currently considering the adoption of a 10P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers. While I understand the reasoning behind this proposal, I believe that it is misguided and will not effectively address the issues it aims to solve.\\n\\nFirstly, the proposed curfews will have a significant impact on the lives of teenagers who have after-school activities or jobs. These activities and jobs are important to the development and well-being of young people, and restricting their ability to participate in them will not help them to reach their full potential. Additionally, many teenagers have to stay up late to complete schoolwork or study for exams, and a curfew would make it difficult for them to balance their responsibilities.\\n\\nSecondly, the proposed curfews do not take into account the fact that teenagers are capable of staying up much longer than adults. While it is true that teenagers may stay up later than they should, this is not because they are bored or lack discipline, but because they are trying to prove their independence and responsibility. By imposing a curfew, the city council is essentially telling teenagers that they are not capable of making their own decisions and that they need to be controlled.\\n\\nFinally, the proposed curfews do not address the root causes of the issues that they aim to solve. For example, the main reason why people are on the road at night is because they are under the influence of alcohol or drugs. A curfew will not prevent this behavior, and in fact, it may even make it more dangerous. Additionally, the proposed curfews do not address the issue of deer or other dangerous animals that may be on the road at night.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while I understand the reasoning behind the proposed curfews, I believe that they are misguided and will not effectively address the issues they aim to solve. Instead of imposing restrictions on teenagers, the city council should focus on providing them with the support and resources they need to make responsible decisions and stay safe.',\n",

Everyday people are dying in car accidents because they're using their phones while driving. Many people today believe that cell phones are one of the most leading factors in car accidents. Despite the fact that they're putting themselves in danger, people still use their phone while driving because they don't want to miss anything and to contact others. Are people's texting conversations that important, that they risk crashing their car, or putting not only your life but the life of other people at risk.\\n\\nNot only is texting or talking behind the wheel bad enough, but many people compare this to drinking and driving as well. Drunk driving is another leading factor in car accidents everyday. These two things are closely related to each other because of how many injuries or deaths they both have caused. Some say that texting while driving is even more dangerous than drunk driving, but people still don't realize the danger of it.\\n\\nMany people argue that having a bluetooth will make it easier for them to stay on the phone while staying focused on the road while driving. they also say that it's more useful to them. But that can also distract them from the road as well, they could be in a very important conversation that can cause them to lose focus of what they're doing and they could end up in a bad car wreck. If the phone call or text is that important, than they should take time to pull over into a parking lot so they can answer it instead of trying to answer it in the car. Most people believe that staying connected to the outside world is more important than focusing on the road but it really isn't.\\n\\nAnd even though there are laws that ban the use of cell phones while driving it hasn't stopped the amount of car crashes every day. The government can put a law to ban the use of phones while in the car, but they can't stop People from using it because it's not as easy for police to see when people are on their phones as it is for them to determine how fast you are going or headlights are off. People just don't see the use in banning phones and don't follow them.\\n\\nI personally feel like people should stop using their phones as well and stay focused. If people truly want to stay safe then there are plenty of ways of doing this like putting their phones on silent and not on vibrate. They can also turn their phones completely off. And if they can do that it will at least lessen all the crashes. When you're behind the wheel, you should never have your attention on your cell phone. It's important to be alert at all times. You should always keep your eyes on the road.\\n\\n1            \",\n",

       " 'Dear Principal,\\n\\nI completely agree with you on the fact that students should have to earn a B average grade in order to do any extra-curricular activities. I think that this should really be enforced. We shouldn\\'t let anything get in the way of our education, because no one can take that from us. It gives us the skills we need for life, a chance for better opportunities, and it gives us a discipline that we will need as we get older.\\n\\nFor one of all reasons, students are here primarily to learn. Without learning, we won\\'t be able to do the activities we do. As a musician, you have to be able to count your music notes to know when to sing or play them at what time. You need math for this. In basketball you have to know when and where is a good time and place to shoot the ball into the hoop. You need science for this. Without our education, it\\'s impossible to do these things.\\n\\nSecond, many students who are in activities are expecting to do it professionally when they get older. It\\'s a one in a million chance that you will get drafted out of high school, or become the next famous musician in high school. Even if you do, coaches and talent agents wants the person with the better grades, and most school experience. They want an intelligent person who can take their team or band to the next level.\\n\\nYou\\'ll need an education to go to college so you will get a chance to pursue your dreams. You won\\'t get discovered in Community College. So, you will need the best grades you can get to go to the best colleges in the nation, which will open so many opportunities for students.\\n\\nThird, if students are failing, and still attend extra-curricular activities, that shows a lack of discipline that they will need in order to survive in our world. If they think that they can fail a subject, and still have the luxury to take fun activities, then that takes away responsibilities. If they\\'re the best football player in the country, and don\\'t know any math, how are they going to be able to pay for their bills, or do their taxes. They\\'ll rely on others to do it for them, who could possibly steal their money because of the lack of discipline they had in school.\\n\\nWithout education, our world is impossible to grow. We rely on mathematicians to advance our world financially.

       " 'The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly recognized around the world. This is due to several reasons, such as the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and create more sustainable communities. By implementing measures to reduce car ownership and promote alternative forms of transportation, cities and suburbs can experience numerous benefits.\\n\\nOne advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By encouraging people to rely less on cars and more on public transportation, walking, or cycling, cities can significantly decrease their carbon footprint. This is crucial in the fight against climate change and the achievement of environmental sustainability.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. In the passage set, it is mentioned that high levels of smog and pollution were observed in cities like Paris and Beijing, primarily due to car emissions. By reducing the number of cars on the road, especially in densely populated areas, cities can improve air quality and prevent respiratory issues. This is particularly important for vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly.\\n\\nAdditionally, limiting car usage can lead to more livable and sustainable communities. In the passage set, examples such as Vauban in Germany and Bogota in Colombia are highlighted for their successful implementation of car-free or car-reduced initiatives. These communities have prioritized public transportation, walking, and cycling, making it easier for residents to access essential services and amenities without relying on cars. By creating walkable neighborhoods with easy access to public transportation, cities can promote healthier lifestyles, reduce traffic congestion, and improve overall quality of life for residents.\\n\\nMoreover, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passage set mentions that car ownership can be expensive, with high costs associated with purchasing, maintaining, and fueling cars. By reducing car ownership and promoting alternative transportation options, individuals can save money on car-related expenses. Additionally, cities can invest in public transportation infrastructure, creating job opportunities and stimulating economic growth.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there are several advantages of limiting car usage. By reducing the reliance on cars and promoting alternative forms of transportation, cities can significantly decrease greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, create more sustainable communities, and provide economic benefits. It is important for cities and individuals to recognize the potential benefits of limiting car usage and take steps towards implementing measures to achieve these advantages.',\n",

Third, the author say that NASA has one particular idea for sending human to study Venus, and he compared with a 'blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or something miles above roiling Venusuian landscape'. He also included the World War ll technology called mechanical computer, and it doesn not required electronics. Finally, Venus is the hottest planet and it is beyond high pressure and heat. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it many well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. the authors example in every detail and why it is dangerous it presents.

In Bradford Plumbers article he states \"The electoral colledge is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.\" The sad part about that is true. Yes, it was made hundreds of years ago and it worked but as time goes on and technology changes, the world changes, and some things just are not the same and dont fit anymore.\\n\\nAs some of the state of Florida coming together, the electoral college does consist of some advantages, for say to avoid run-off elections, as Richard A. Posner says, and \"restore some of the weigh in the political balance\"... but\\n\\nIT\\'S NOT FAIR\\n\\n.\\n\\nAs we vote, we vote for the state of electors. Not the president ourselves, they do it for us. If we are not allowed to vote on our own then why even let us vote anways. I feel we are being baby feed. If this is true why even give us any rights as a human being living in the United States all together? Can we not control who we vote for? Sooner or later we wont even watch the presidental elections or even vote and you all will be on your own!\\n\\nTo go along with, I feel that if the electoral college was abolished, then it would be easier on everyone, expecially the senate. Again in Bradford Plumbers articile, \"Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates do not spend time in states they know have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states.\" If we are not in a swing state then what are our chances of seeing the candidtes or even a campaign.

As a student, I have a unique perspective on this issue, and I'd like to share my thoughts with you.\\n\\nIn my opinion, Policy 1 is the better choice. Here's why:\\n\\nFirstly, smartphones are an essential tool for communication. With Policy 1, we can use our phones during lunch and free time to stay in touch with our friends and family. This is especially important for students who have parents who work late or have younger siblings who need to be picked up from school. It's also helpful for us to be able to communicate with our group members for projects or assignments.\\n\\nSecondly, smartphones are also a great resource for learning. With Policy 1, we can use our phones to access educational apps, look up information, and take notes during class. This will help us to learn more efficiently and stay organized.\\n\\nThirdly, trust is a significant issue in schools. By allowing us to have our phones during certain times, you are showing us that you trust us to use them responsibly. This will create a positive atmosphere in the school, where students feel respected and valued.\\n\\nLastly, it's essential to consider the safety aspect. With Policy 1, we can have our phones with us during emergencies like a fire drill or a lockdown. In such situations, it's crucial to have a means of communication to contact our parents or authorities.\\n\\nI understand that some people might argue that having phones at school can be distracting. However, I believe that it's up to us as students to use our phones responsibly. We can set boundaries and rules for ourselves to ensure that we don't get distracted during class.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that Policy 1 is the better choice for our school. It allows us to communicate, learn, and stay safe while also promoting a positive and trusting environment. I hope you will consider my points and implement Policy 1.\\n\\nThank you for taking the time to read my letter.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]\",\n",
       " \"As an 8th grade student, I have noticed that cell phones have become an integral part of our daily lives, including in the classroom. While some teachers allow students to use their phones during class, others strictly prohibit their use. I believe that the use of cell phones in the classroom can have both positive and negative effects on students' ability to learn, as well as safety risks when they are allowed inside the classroom.\\n\\nOn the one hand, allowing students to use their phones in the classroom can enhance their learning experience. For instance, students can use their phones to access educational apps, take notes, and look up information quickly. This can help them stay engaged and motivated during class, especially when they are learning new concepts. Additionally, phones can be useful for collaboration and communication among students, which can foster a sense of community and teamwork in the classroom.\\n\\nOn the other hand, there are also potential safety risks associated with allowing students to use their phones in the classroom. For example, students may use their phones to access inappropriate content, such as social media or games, during class. This can be distracting and disruptive, and can hinder the learning process. Moreover, phones can be a source of bullying and harassment, as students may use them to send mean or threatening messages to their peers.\\n\\nAnother important aspect to consider is the potential benefits of utilizing cell phones for educational purposes in the classroom. Some schools have implemented programs that allow students to use their phones to access educational content, such as online textbooks, videos, and interactive lessons. These programs can help students learn more effectively and efficiently, as they can access information on their own time and at their own pace.\\n\\nFinally, it's worth looking into laws or regulations about cell phone use in the classroom in other countries. For example, some countries have implemented strict regulations on cell phone use in schools, such as banning phones during class time or requiring students to keep their phones in a designated area. This can help ensure that students are focused on their learning and not distracted by their phones.\\n\\nTo protect against inappropriate use of phones in the classroom, the school could take several measures. For instance, they could set\",\n",
       " \" There was a girl named Sarah, who dreamed of becoming a professional violinist. However, as she tried to get back into the hobby, she found herself struggling. Sarah practiced every day, no matter how difficult it got. Despite making numerous mistakes along the way, she persevered and eventually achieved her goal. In my opinion, failure is a necessary step towards success.\\n\\nFirstly, failure is often the catalyst for growth and improvement. When we fail, we are forced to reflect on our actions and identify areas where we need to improve. For example, if a student fails a test, they may need to review their study habits and adjust their approach to better understand the material. Similarly, if an athlete fails to execute a play correctly, they may need to practice their technique and work on their timing. By learning from our failures, we can become stronger and more resilient, ultimately leading to greater success.\\n\\nSecondly, failure is a natural part of the learning process. Everyone makes mistakes, whether it's in school, work, or personal life. It's important to remember that failure is not a reflection of our worth or intelligence, but rather a learning opportunity. For instance, if a chef fails to make a perfect dish, they may need to adjust their recipe or technique. Similarly, if a writer fails to complete a project on time, they may need to break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks. By embracing failure as a part of the learning process, we can become more confident in our abilities and better equipped to handle future challenges.\\n\\nLastly, failure can be a motivating factor. When we set goals for ourselves and work hard to achieve them, it's natural to feel disappointed when we don't meet our expectations. However, this disappointment can be a powerful motivator. For example, if an artist fails to sell their paintings at a gallery show, they may be motivated to work harder and improve their craft. Similarly, if a student fails to get into their dream school, they may be motivated to work harder in their classes and apply to other schools. By using failure as a motivator, we can push ourselves to achieve our goals and become even more successful.\\n\\nIn conclusion, failure is an essential part of the journey towards success. It's a natural part of the learning process, a catalyst for growth and improvement, and a powerful motivator\",\n",

We must be willing to take responsibility for our actions and strive to become the best version of ourselves. By doing so, we can overcome any obstacles that come our way and achieve our goals.\\n\\nFor example, if someone tells you that you are not good at your job, but you know that you are doing well and everyone else tells you that you are doing great, then you must believe in yourself and your abilities. You must be confident in your strengths and continue to work hard to improve.\\n\\nOn the other hand, some people believe that traits are inherited from our ancestors or are predetermined by our upbringing.

One reason why cell phones should not be aloud in school is other schools might not allow cell phones so who are we going text or call and why would we just text a person that is only down the hall that we will be talking to in a few minutes at lunch. Another reason why cell phones should not be allowed in school is the halls and the lunch room would be really loud from all of the ring tones. That would be really annoying to the students in class. We come to school to learn and having cell phones around us is just distracting. Next thing you'll know students will start bringing ipods, portable gaming systems, and more.

       " 'One of the pros of using video conferencing as an alternative to online classes for students who do not have access to a computer at home is the ability to continue their education with minimal disruption to their learning experiences. Video conferencing provides an easy way for students to participate in their classes without the need for a physical classroom, allowing parents to spend less money on associated costs such as commuting. Additionally, this method of teaching also helps to reduce the digital divide, as students can access educational content from any location with an internet connection. \\n\\nOn the other hand, there are a few potential cons to consider. For example, video conferencing can be difficult for parents to monitor, as it can be hard to know what is happening in the class unless they are actively monitoring the session. Furthermore, some students may struggle to keep up with the pace of the lecture or require additional guidance and assistance from the teacher during the video conference. Lastly, the technology itself can cause issues, as a poor internet connection can lead to slow or unreliable video conferencing, which can disrupt the lesson.',\n",

The differences in knowledge levels between older and younger students can impede education in several ways.\\n\\nFirstly, older students may struggle to keep up with the pace of younger students, who may have a better understanding of the material. This can lead to frustration and disengagement, which can negatively impact their learning. Additionally, younger students may become bored with the material and lose interest, which can also hinder their learning.\\n\\nTo address this challenge, teachers can use a variety of methods to differentiate instruction for students of different ages. This can include providing additional support for older students, such as extra practice or additional resources, and providing more challenging tasks for younger students. Teachers can also use group work and peer teaching to facilitate learning and engagement.\\n\\nThe experiences of a student described in the essay can differ from other similar programs in several ways. For example, the student may have been in a program that was specifically designed for students of different ages, which may have provided more support and resources for older students. Additionally, the student may have been in a program that was more structured and focused on specific learning objectives, which may have helped to keep all students engaged and motivated.\\n\\nWhen comparing the advantages and disadvantages of programs with older and younger students, it is important to consider the unique needs and characteristics of each group. On one hand, programs with older and younger students can provide opportunities for intergenerational learning and collaboration, which can enhance student engagement and motivation. On the other hand, the differences in knowledge levels can impede education and lead to frustration and disengagement.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while programs with older and younger students can have some advantages, research has shown that they can also have a negative impact on student learning.

       " 'Working with a group versus working alone has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. While some people prefer to work alone, others find group work to be more beneficial. In this essay, we will compare and contrast the benefits of working with a group versus working alone.\\n\\nOne of the biggest benefits of working with a group is the ability to share ideas and perspectives. When working with a group, individuals can bounce ideas off each other and get feedback on their work. This can lead to more creative and innovative solutions to problems. Additionally, group work can help individuals learn from their peers and gain a different perspective on a topic.\\n\\nAnother benefit of working with a group is the ability to divide and conquer tasks. When working on a group project, individuals can take on different tasks and responsibilities, which can help to speed up the process. This can also help to ensure that all aspects of the project are covered.\\n\\nOn the other hand, working alone has its own set of benefits. One of the biggest benefits is the ability to focus solely on the task at hand. When working alone, individuals can work at their own pace and without distractions. This can lead to more efficient and effective work. Additionally, working alone can help individuals to develop their own ideas and perspectives without the influence of others.\\n\\nAnother benefit of working alone is the ability to take ownership of the work. When working alone, individuals are solely responsible for their work, which can help to develop a sense of pride and ownership. This can also help to motivate individuals to work harder and produce higher quality work.\\n\\nIn conclusion, working with a group and working alone both have their own set of benefits. Working with a group can lead to more creative and innovative solutions, as well as the ability to divide and conquer tasks. Working alone can lead to more efficient and effective work, as well as the ability to take ownership of the work.

While not everyone may possess an optimistic outlook at all times, having a good attitude can greatly benefit individuals in various ways.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, a good attitude can help people overcome obstacles and challenges they face. It allows them to maintain a sense of hope and perseverance, which can be crucial in achieving success. For example, athletes often face setbacks and injuries, but those who maintain a positive attitude are more likely to recover and continue pushing forward towards their goals.\\n\\nMoreover, having a good attitude can also lead to greater opportunities and experiences. When people approach challenges with a positive mindset, they are more likely to be open to new possibilities and take risks. This can lead to a greater sense of fulfillment and satisfaction in life. For instance, a person who is always looking for ways to improve themselves and their situation is more likely to stumble upon new opportunities and experiences that can help them grow.\\n\\nAdditionally, a good attitude can also have a positive impact on others. When people are surrounded by positive energy and optimism, it can be contagious, leading to a more positive and productive environment. This can be especially beneficial in the workplace or in social settings, where a positive attitude can help to build stronger relationships and foster a sense of community.\\n\\nOverall, having a good attitude is essential in navigating any situation. It can help individuals overcome challenges, seize opportunities, and create a positive impact on those around them.

I love walking, i can get exercise and have fun because im with my friends. car riding can be extremely dangerous too.\\n\\nFirst of all, driving a car could be very dangerous. For example, some people like to drive while texting which could result in a serious accident. Another reason is not paying attention to the other drivers near you. Kids should not be behind the wheel of a car yet. I say that because they do not take as serious as adults. Teens also like to drive fast to show off or have loud music blasting, these are also advantages of limiting car usage. Car accidents would decrease dramatically.\\n\\nSecond of all, cars take up too much gas which takes up a lot of our money, Walking would be super cheap because you do not have to pay to walk. Driving around 247 makes us really lazy. Walking to where we need to go gives us exercise, and quite frankly everyone needs some exercise or a little work out. The goverment will even make more pathways or trails for us to travel on. I understand if you are leaving town for a family vacation or going somewhere that is not walking distance, the city has various types of motor transportation, like city buses, cabs, bikes, and do not forget about our planes.\\n\\nThird of all, im not saying completely get rid of cars just limit how much you drive. Instead of buying car after car after car carpool with friends. That way you can still get to where you gotta go quickly and lower emissions. People do not drive as much as they used to, i found out by a study that driving decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Lets try to make that 50 percent. People do not really care about a car, they just want a quick way to get from A to B. All we gotta do is Find a safer more cheaper way for them to do that and the percentage will drop rapidly.\\n\\nIn Conclusion, limiting car usage can be improved by getting people to walk more. Carpool with friends, ride bikes, takes buses, cabs, even planes to where they have to go. This will help our enviorment to be much safer and healthier.

As result, several ideas about how to influence people emerged, such as an internal agreement through the creation of the early constitution in Athens by Aristotle. Early constitution which tried to combat the earliest authoritarian ways to influence people through force. However, those ways to influence people were not effective because those factors dictate the people\\'s actions and created a hostile environment. Therefore, the best way to influence others is by our own behavior setting a good example because this generates stability, creates higher standards, and effectiveness.\\n\\nHenceforth, setting a good example generates stability because this do not create a patron of dictatorship that generate differences and hostilities between the relationship follower-influencer. As result, this factor create an ideal and healthier relationship, which is reflected in the quality of the relationship environment. As a consequence, the stability created it by our own behavior and example make our message easier to be transmit it and receive it. For example, the relationship parent-son. This particular and common relationship completely reflected the influence of a good example and how the parent behavior dictate the stability in the family, especially in his relationship with the son. As result, if the parent set a good example and behavior the son would be more open to receive the parent\\'s influence. Therefore, a high grade of empathy would be developed. As result, there would not be any differences and hostilities that can damage the stability of the relationship.\\n\\nHowever, many people still argue that there are different ways to influence others rather than setting a good example, such as internal agreements (e. i., constitution and other behavior codes). However, those ways still fall into the dictatorship and authoritarian scheme that make people disagree and create conflict. In addition, those rudimentary and forcing methods do not help the persons and the influencer-follower environment. In contrast, deteriorate and break any possibility of improvement because this authoritarian limit you, instead develop you. Therefore, by showing a good behavior and setting a good example the influencing process change drastically because this process became more active, inclusive, and dynamic. As result, this influencing way create higher standards because this method of influencing people promote values such as integration and solidarity that reach improvement and cooperation. As result, the higher standards break the authoritarian barrier and open the path for cooperation, participation, and admiration in the follower-influencer relationship.\\n\\nTherefore, a great example led by a good behavior becomes more effective because there is a dynamic cooperation between followers and influencers that boosted their performance and empathy in the relationship. Hence this dynamic cooperation becomes stronger, as result the relationship reach incredible stages of solidarity, which is translated into a better and healthier way to influence people. In contrast, the old \"fashioned\" authoritarian ways to influence people just deteriorate the follower-influencer relationship by dictating and forcing the followers\\' actions. As result, the net influence, effectiveness, and impact by the authoritarian ways become lower than setting a good example and behavior. For example, the actions by the Mohammad Gandhi in India with his pacific civilian disobedience movement; where he led an incredible number of people just by example and a good behavior through the diverse hostilities. This show the huge impact of setting a good example and the effectiveness that this way have on influencing people. Therefore, setting a good example is the best way to influence others because this way is the less damaging and authoritarian, and more inclusive and beneficial method to achieve a greater result. In addition, because this method promotes solidarity and unity, instead of division and competition. Lastly, because this method highlight humanity instead of cruelty.',\n",

We are not infallible, and we will inevitably experience setbacks in our lives. However, it is how we learn from these failures that determines our success. Failure teaches us valuable lessons and helps us to grow as individuals. It forces us to reevaluate our actions and make changes in order to achieve our goals.\\n\\nFurthermore, failure helps to build resilience. When we face challenges and overcome them, we become stronger and more resilient. This resilience is essential for success in any aspect of life, whether it be personal or professional.\\n\\nHowever, it is important to note that failure is not the only obstacle that we may face on our path to success. There are many other factors that can hinder our progress, such as lack of resources, lack of support, and external circumstances beyond our control.\\n\\nIn these situations, it is important to remain persistent and continue to fight for our goals. We must not give up, even when the odds seem stacked against us. Instead, we must use our failures as motivation to continue pushing forward.\\n\\nOne example of this is the story of Oprah Winfrey. Oprah faced many challenges in her life, including poverty, abuse, and discrimination. However, she never gave up and continued to fight for her goals. Today, she is a successful media mogul and philanthropist, and her story serves as an inspiration to many.\\n\\nSimilarly, immigrants face many challenges as they work to build a better life for themselves and their families. They must be persistent and continue to fight for their goals, even when faced with obstacles such as language barriers, cultural differences, and discrimination.\\n\\nIn conclusion, success is not an easy achievement, and it is not something that can be handed to us. We must work hard and overcome obstacles in order to achieve our goals. Failure is an inevitable part of this process, but it is how we learn from these failures that determines our success. We must remain persistent and continue to fight for our goals, even when the odds seem stacked against us. By doing so, we can create',\n",
       " 'I believe that video games do not contribute to violent behavior. There are several reasons why I hold this position.\\n\\nFirstly, many studies have shown no correlation between playing video games and violent behavior. For example, a study conducted by the University of Oxford found that there was no link between playing violent video games and aggressive behavior in teenagers. In fact, the study showed that playing video games can actually have a positive effect on mental health, as it provides an outlet for stress and helps improve cognitive skills.\\n\\nSecondly, it is important to consider the content of the video games themselves. While some games may contain violent themes, they are often fantasy-based and not reflective of real-life situations. Additionally, many popular games, such as Minecraft and The Sims, are non-violent and focused on creative problem-solving and social interaction.\\n\\nFinally, it is unfair to blame video games for violent behavior when there are many other factors at play, such as upbringing, mental health, and exposure to real-life violence. It is important to address these underlying issues rather than scapegoating video games.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while it is understandable to be concerned about the potential impact of video games on behavior, I believe that there is no evidence to suggest that video games contribute to violent behavior. Instead, we should focus on addressing the root causes of violence and promoting healthy outlets for stress and entertainment.',\n",
       " 'The author makes a very good case about going to Venus, but there are many dangers about going there. One example of those dangers is the average tempature of 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Another one of those dangers is the atmospheric pressure. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than the ones found here on Eath.\\n\\nThe author suggests ways that could make those danger less noticeable. One way the author suggests this is by a project that The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has been working on. The project is a huge blimp like aircraft. It would travel 30 miles up in the atmosphere and have an average tempature of 170 degrees Fahrenheit. This would also make it possiable to have humans in the atmosphere of Venus.\\n\\nSo in conclution Venus is a worthy pursit. The author did make a good argument that it is worthy to explore Venus, but i would not like to go to Venus anytime soon. Those are just a couple of ways that the author supports the idea that it is worthy to pursue the idea of exploring Venus.',\n",

       " \"Peoples often ask for advices from diffrent peoples. They do this because they want to get a better undrstanding of what they should do. When you ask mulitple peoples for advices, you can get diffrent point of views. This can help you because you can see what each person is saying and then you can put it all together to make a good choise. For example, if you ask your teacher and your parents for advices on weather you should do your homework or play a video game, your teacher might say that you should do your homework so you can get good grades. But your parents might say that it's importint to have fun and play video games so you can relese stress. Then you can think about both sides and decide what you want to do.\\n\\nAnother reason why it's good to ask mulitple peoples for advices is that you can get more information. If you only ask one person, they might not know everything about the subjet. But if you ask more peoples, you can get a better undrstanding of the subjet because each person might know something diferent. For example, if you ask your friends and your brother for advices on how to make a good fist, your friends might say that you should curl your fingers and your brother might say that you should keep your thumb outside. Then you can put it all together and make a good fist.\\n\\nSometimess asking mulitple peoples for advices can also help you to not make a mistake. If you only ask one person, they might tell you something that is not true. But if you ask more peoples, you can check if what they are saying is true or not. For example, if you ask your teacher and your friend for advices on weather you should jump of a bridge, your teacher might say that it's not a good idear and your friend might say that it's a bad idear to. Then you can see that it's not a good choise to jump of a bridge.\\n\\nIn conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can help you to make a better choise because you can get diffrent point of views, more information, and you can avoit making a mistake. So the next time you need to make a choise, ask mulitple peoples for advices and think carefully about what they say.\",\n",
       " \"There are many benefits of asking multiple people for advice. This is because when you ask many different people that may have different opinions, you may get an answer that is right for everyone, but especially you. Keeping others thoughts in mind will help you get the perfect answer. When you ask for advice on something, you could ask many people, and maybe some of them know exactly what to say because they have been in your shoes before, and know how to answer. All these other opinions can help shape your opinion, and here are ways they can help you in the real world.\\n\\nChoosing what to do can always be hard, but with more people and different opinions, you can decide what you want. Do you ever have to choose between two things and do not know what to choose? For example, when you go to the mall and you find two pairs of shoes that appeal to you so much that you just want both? But you have to pick one pair, and only one. You can ask your friends which pair they like better and get the one everyone likes better. It doesnt effect you because you liked both pairs equally and would\\xa0not mind getting the one they proffered. As well as choosing between two options and using others opinions to choose something, you can use others opinions on what to choose something when there are so many more options.\\n\\nOn a regular basis I never know what to eat. There are so many foods that I choose from, ans so many restaurants. But sometimes I dont crave anything and just was something to eat. I dont want to go somewhere that I always go to, but I dot want to go somewhere that i have never been to and have a really bad meal. Thats why I always ask other people to help me find a place. I ask other people what they would recommend, and they give me options. They could suggest a place they really like, that I have never heard of. Or they could suggest something I know of that I havent thought about. Making decisions based on other peoples opinions is easy, and can help you choose something when there are so many options and you don't know what to do.\\n\\nLastly, I feel like this is the most important way of getting someones opinion on something to help you. When someone you know is feeling down and you do not know how to help them, you can ask other people for help on what to say or how to approach the situation . You could ask a friend, or someone you know well for advice on how to handle a situation. You want to help your friend feel better and happy but you dont know what to do because you dont what to make anything worst by saying something wrong. If you really need help and the situation is really out of control, you could go to professionals for help. Its always okay to ask others for help and their opinions so you will know what to do.\\n\\nIn conclusion, asking others for advice is always a good thing to keep in mind. Either if its serious or simple, asking for advice is always good. Asking multiple people and getting many different opinions on how to approach situations will make your choice on what to do better. Everyone is different and you need to understand other peoples beliefs and why they choose to do things , and with that you can use some of their opinion and put it into yours.\\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\",\n",
       " 'Distance learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, and it has the potential to provide more opportunities for students who cannot attend school due to financial or other restrictions. In this essay, I will discuss how distance learning can provide more opportunities for these students and compare the benefits to traditional methods of education.\\n\\nOne of the main benefits of distance learning is that it allows students to attend school from anywhere with an internet connection. This means that students who live in areas with limited resources or who cannot afford to move to a new location can still receive an education. Additionally, distance learning can be more flexible than traditional methods, as students can complete coursework at their own pace and on their own schedule. This can be particularly beneficial for students who have other commitments, such as jobs or family responsibilities.\\n\\nAnother advantage of distance learning is that it can be more affordable than traditional methods. Tuition costs can be significantly lower, and students do not have to worry about the additional expenses associated with attending school on campus, such as housing, transportation, and meal plans. This can make education more accessible to students who may not have been able to afford it otherwise.\\n\\nIn contrast, traditional methods of education can be less flexible and more expensive. Students are required to attend classes at specific times and in specific locations, which can be a challenge for those with other commitments. Additionally, tuition costs can be significantly higher, and students may need to take out loans or find other ways to finance their education. This can make education less accessible to students who may not have the financial resources to attend school on campus.\\n\\nWhile distance learning has its advantages, it is not without its challenges. For example, students may struggle with self-motivation and discipline, as they are responsible for completing their coursework on their own. Additionally, students may miss out on the social aspects of attending school on campus, such as interacting with their peers and participating in extracurricular activities.\\n\\nIn conclusion, distance learning has the potential to provide more opportunities for students who cannot attend school due to financial or other restrictions. It is more flexible and affordable than traditional methods, and can make education more accessible to a wider range of students. While there are challenges associated with distance learning, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. By providing more opportunities for students, distance learning can help to ensure that everyone has access to a quality education.',\n",

In addition, these activities can be a great way to make friends and broaden social networks. \\n\\nHowever, working with a team or group of people can present its own set of challenges. Disagreements and arguments are common, and it can be difficult for everyone to share an opinion without offending someone else. In order to manage these differences, it is important to agree on a few ground rules in advance.

Driverless cars can fix all these problems easily.\\n\\nOne issue is that people easily get distracted. Smart cars, on the otherhand, are complety built for the purpose of diving and analizing the roads. The feature most appealing to me and that fixes this issue is found here in the passage, \" Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car\\'s surroundings.\".\\n\\nThe second issue with drivers in cars are the drivers reaction times being to slow. Some people just do not have the reactions to be able to use the breaks fast enough to avoid accidents. These cars do it instantly, as stated in the passage, \" The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply breaks on individual wheels and reduce power from ethe engine, allowing far bettter response and control than a human driver could manage alone.\".\\n\\nFinaly, sometimes people just are not safe. Doing anything from texting while driving or taking erratic turns without signal can be extreamly dangerous to themselfs or anyone around them. These cars can prevent that by even forcing people to watch the road constantly or alerting us when danger is ahead. \" GM has developed driver\\'s seats to vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object.\". This is only one of many safty enhancing developments to smart cars and the protection of the \"driver\".\\n\\nIn conclution, smart cars are a great idea.

       " \"When you ask for advice do you ask multiple people or just one person? from my experience its better to get more peoples advice then just one. I believe that it is better to ask multiple people for advice instead of just asking one person because if you ask multiple people then you have a higher chance to get better advice than if you only ask one person, you will get more advice than if you just ask one person, and you will also become closer friends with the people you ask for advice.\\n\\nFirstly, I think that asking multiple people for advice is better because if you ask more people then you have a higher chance to get better advice than if you just ask one person. Also if you get better advice then you wont have to ask more people for advice. Plus when you get better advice you will probably do better then if you had worse advice or none at all. The better the advice the better you'll do at what ever your trying to do no matter what it is advice always helps.\\n\\nNext, I think that its better to ask more people for advice because the more advice the more it helps, first because you will remember it better and also because you will get different and better advice. another reason why getting more advice is better is because you will get different viewpoints and you will also get to see things from other peoples points of view.\\n\\nFinally, you will get closer to the people you ask for advice because they know that you would not come to them if you didn't trust them so they will know that you trust them and they will trust you more. Plus if they trust you more then you will be able to talk to them about more personal stuff like help with problems like depression, anxiety, or stress and they will be there for you no matter what.\\n\\nLike I said before I believe that asking for advice from multiple people is better and you should ask at least three people for advice but the more the merrier. Dont forget that the more people you ask for advice the more types of advice you will get and possibly the better advice you will get. I believe that if you ask for advice from more then one person the better advice you will get, the more advice you will get, the closer you will get to you friends.\",\n",

       " \"As an eighth-grade student, I have had the opportunity to attend a traditional school and take classes online. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, and the potential impacts on learning outcomes and social interaction are important factors to consider.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of attending a traditional school is the opportunity for face-to-face interaction with teachers and classmates. This allows for real-time feedback and the ability to ask questions in person. Additionally, attending a traditional school provides a structured environment with set schedules and routines that can help students stay organized and motivated.\\n\\nOn the other hand, taking classes online offers more flexibility and convenience. Students can attend classes from the comfort of their own home, which can be especially beneficial for those with busy schedules or difficult commutes. Online classes also often have a wider range of resources and materials available, such as videos, readings, and interactive quizzes.\\n\\nHowever, there are also potential disadvantages to both methods. For example, attending a traditional school can be more expensive, as it often requires tuition, books, and other materials. Additionally, online classes may require a computer and internet connection, which not all students have access to.\\n\\nIn terms of learning outcomes, research has shown that both online and traditional classroom learning can be effective. However, some studies have suggested that students taking classes online may have a slight advantage in terms of self-motivation and the ability to learn at their own pace.\\n\\nWhen it comes to standard educational tests such as the SOL, students studying online or at home may perform similarly to those attending a traditional school. However, it's important to note that these tests are just one measure of learning outcomes, and there are many other factors that can contribute to a student's success.\\n\\nFinally, social interaction is an important aspect of the educational experience. While attending a traditional school provides opportunities for face-to-face interaction with classmates and teachers, online classes may require students to be more proactive in seeking out social interaction. This can be challenging for some students, but there are many online resources and communities available to help students connect with others.\\n\\nIn conclusion, both online and traditional classroom learning have their advantages and disadvantages.

       " \"In today's world, it is of paramount importance to continue to learn new skills and information, both for success and personal growth. Ralph Waldo Emerson emphasized the significance of this by noting, “Life is a journey, not a destination.” His message is that knowledge is obtained through the journey of life, and only through continual learning can one reach their goals. \\n\\nThis concept is evident in everyday life. For example, individuals from all walks of life may take a class to learn a new skill, such as a coding language or baking. By engaging in such activities, people are able to gain knowledge while also expanding their interests and gaining insight into what they enjoy.\\n\\nEducation is key when it comes to discovering new passions. Researchers have long noted the importance of education in discovering new interests and hobbies. Studies have found that the more time individuals spend with their studies, the more likely they are to discover talents and interests they were previously unaware of. Furthermore, it is these activities one learns through their studies that eventually lead to a career or pursuit one is passionate about.\\n\\nTherefore, it is essential to continuously push yourself further in life, despite what you have already accomplished.

For example, I play video games with my friends regularly, and we have never been involved in any fights or arguments due to playing video games. In fact, playing video games can be a fun and harmless way to pass the time.\\n\\nSecondly, there are many other factors that contribute to violent behavior, such as a person's upbringing, environment, and mental health. Blaming video games for violent behavior is an oversimplification of a complex issue.\\n\\nLastly, there are many non-violent video games that are available for people to play. These games are designed to be educational or entertaining without promoting violence. For example, games like Minecraft, Animal Crossing, and Mario Kart are all popular video games that do not involve violence.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while there may be some video games that promote violence, it is not fair to generalize all video games as contributing to violent behavior. Many other factors play a role in shaping a person's behavior, and it is important to consider all of these factors when discussing the impact of video games on behavior.\",\n",
       " 'Summer is a time for students to have fun and be able to relax without worrying about school work. However, some schools assign summer projects over the students break to make sure students are still learning throughout the year. A common question about these projects is who designes them. Should the teachers design them so that is stays on topic to what they need to learn, or should the Students themselves design the projects so that the projects are subjects that students are interested in. Student projects over summer break should be student designed because it gives students more freedom, allows students to do them in areas they have interests in, and allows students to create a type of project they are good at.\\n\\nA common arguement against student designed projects is that the student will not stay on topic and will go to far off topic. Meanwhile if a teacher were to assign a project they would make sure that the student did not go off topic and it would be relative to the subject. However, a student designed project has much more benefits than a teacher designed project. It also will give teachers more time to get ready for the next school year if they do not need to design all the students projects. Even though teacher designed projects would be more on topic than a student designed project, Student designed projects pros outweigh the cons and therefore students summer projects should be designed by students.\\n\\nStudent designed projects allow students to give themselves more freedom over the summer by being able to design your own projects. Students most likely do not like projects over the summer in the first place, but if the students design their own projects, they are able to choose to do the project how they would like to do it. If they were teacher designed projects then the students would not want to do them because they had no choice in picking what they were doing and will most likely not do it. Students want freedom, they dont want to be told what to do, if a schools were to give them teacher designed projects then students would not be as motivated to complete them as much as a student designed project. If it was a student designed project, students would also be able to choose a topic they like.\\n\\nStudents are not always interested in every subject at school, in fact, most students are really only interested in one or two subjects at school. If schools allowed students to design their own project then they would be able to make their project about a topic that interests them. If it were a teacher designed project then students would be forced to do a project on a topic that they might not intersted and not want to put a lot of effort into it. If it were a student designed project then they would be able to do a project on a topic that interests them and would be more passionate about the project and would put a lot more effort into it. Students would be much more motivated to complete their projects over the summer if they could design their own projects arounds topics they have interests in. Student designed projects also allow students to design a type of projct they are good at.\\n\\nNot all students are good at writing essays, not all students are good at using powerpoints. Every student is different with what they are comfortable using to create their projects and would prefer to choose how they can present their projects. If the summer projects were teacher designed, then students would not be able to choose how to do their projects. If the teachers decide that the project should be in a essay format, then some students would not be able to complete their project as well as the other students who are good at writing essays giving those students an unfair advantage. If the projects were student designed than each individual student would be able to choose their own project format that works best for them so that all students are on an equal level and no student is at a disadvantage. Allowing students to choose the format of their projects would also give students more motivation to complete the project and make it easier for them.\\n\\nOverall students would put much more effort and thought into the projects over summer break if they were allowed to design their own projects. Teacher designed projects would make students less motivated to work and would cause students to not do their projects. Student designed projects overall would make the students much more motivated to complete the projects over summer break. The projects that are assigned to students over summer break should be allowed to be designed by the students because it gives the students more freedom, allows the students to choose a topic they are interested in, and allows students to create a type of project they are good at.\\xa0',\n",
       " 'As an 8th-grade student, I strongly believe that it is not a good decision to lengthen school hours. While some may argue that longer school days would provide more opportunities for learning and academic success, I believe that the benefits do not outweigh the drawbacks. In this essay, I will provide evidence from my personal experiences and explain how teachers, students, and other school personnel would be affected by the decision. Additionally, I will suggest alternative solutions to extend learning opportunities without increasing school hours.\\n\\nFirstly, I believe that longer school days would negatively impact the mental and physical health of students. As an 8th-grade student, I can attest to the fact that staying in school for longer periods can lead to exhaustion and decreased productivity. This is especially true for students who have extracurricular activities or part-time jobs. Furthermore, studies have shown that students who attend school for longer hours are more likely to experience stress, anxiety, and depression. In addition, longer school days can lead to a decrease in physical activity, which can contribute to obesity and other health problems.\\n\\nSecondly, lengthening school hours would put an additional burden on teachers and other school personnel. Teachers already work long hours, and extending school hours would require them to spend even more time in the classroom. This could lead to burnout and decreased job satisfaction, which could ultimately lead to a shortage of qualified teachers. Additionally, other school personnel such as custodians, librarians, and counselors would also be affected by the decision. This could lead to increased stress and decreased work-life balance.\\n\\nFinally, I believe that there are alternative solutions to extend learning opportunities without increasing school hours. For example, schools could offer after-school programs or summer camps to provide students with additional opportunities to learn and grow. Additionally, schools could partner with local businesses or organizations to provide internships or apprenticeships for students. These opportunities would provide students with real-world experience and help them develop valuable skills.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that it is not a good decision to lengthen school hours. The benefits of longer school days do not outweigh the drawbacks, and the decision would negatively impact the mental and physical health of students, as well as the well-being of teachers and other school personnel. Instead, schools should explore alternative solutions',\n",

Yes it will still need human assistnce once in a while during the times of \"...navigating through road work or accidents.\" Which will keep the ddriver still in control and not putting others and themselves in danger. As said in the text \"The google car simply announces when the driver should be prepaired to take over.\" This may become a problem seeing as most people think that if a car is auto-drive then it needs no human-asscistance and they may just leave it be and let it do it\\'s thing.

       " 'Excerpt: \\nWinston Churchill famously said that “Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.” This quote encapsulates how failure, hope, and enthusiasm are all integral components in achieving success. When we face failure, hope and enthusiasm are the sparks that help us keep going and persevere in our journey. Without hope, it can be easy to give up when faced with failure. And without enthusiasm, hope can quickly turn into discouragement. By combining the two, we are able to face failure head-on and continue striving forward despite the setbacks. With an enthusiasm for the journey, failure is no longer a dead end but rather a learning opportunity. Hope keeps us believing that if we keep trying, we can eventually reach success. Together, hope, failure, and enthusiasm are the essential ingredients for success in life.',\n",

However, it can be difficult to know how to use honesty in a way that does not hurt someone's feelings. While it is sometimes necessary to be truthful, it can be difficult to phrase things in a way that's gentle and kind. This is why learning how to be both honest and compassionate is essential.\\n\\nHonesty can help create new friendships by setting a foundation of mutual respect. When people are open and honest with one another from the start, they often form much stronger connections and a greater level of trust. Additionally, honest conversations can help clear up any misunderstandings or disagreements.\\n\\nIt is important to remember that being honest does not mean being blunt or unkind. While it is necessary to be honest and straightforward, it must be done in a way that benefits both parties emotionally and physically. Being honest can be especially helpful during difficult conversations, as it can prevent potential hurt feelings or misunderstanding.\\n\\nThe conclusion that can be drawn from being honest is that it can help create new friendships and maintain healthy relationships. Learning how to be honest while also being mindful of others’ feelings is an important skill that must be practiced in order to be successful.

If they want to do a good deed and decide to, than that is their opinion of choice. But requiring them to take time out of their busy schedule, and making them do something they really don't want to do is unusual punishment. Choosing to help the community and help to save our environment is a very noble thing to do. Others don't agree that they should help because they have much bigger requirements they must attend to. They might have to take care of a loved one who is very ill, or perhaps attending to work just so they can keep the lights on. High priorities like those can not be put on hold. Others might disagree with my opinion, but I'm standing by it. But in some cases it might straighten out some of the teenagers, in my reflection it might make them rethink everything they've ever done wrong. It might make them realize that all wrong doing has consequences\",\n",

But if she owns a driverless car, the woman could sort out her paper files, fix her hair, and be safe at the same time. Having a driverless car has a positive outlook on itself and the future by providing safety for the drivers that own these driverless cars.\\n\\nA driveless car has a positive outlook for itself by providing safety features too. In passage 8, it states \"In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern.\" This statement explains that the driverless car system does care about the safety of the people who buy it. So if the lady in the story has a regular car, who knows if she will be on time for work, there is a possiblity that she will be, and she will not be ready to go.\\n\\nYes, the driverless car is said to have a negative outlook, but the positive outlook shines more than the negative outlook does. Driverless cars could help people of the future. Everyone has at least seen a movie with a driverless car in it, like Transformers. In the movie, nothing bad happens to the car, the car just drives by itself and both the driver and the car are safe. In passage 7, the article states \"While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver.\" Which mens while the driver is driving and the car is not driving by itself, the car is still watching the driver to make he or she is safe.\\n\\nMany reasons the driverless cars are good inventions for the future is because they are reliable. In passage 7, the author states \"They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.\" This explains how the driverless is safe because when the driver is not driving and the car needs he or she for something, the car will notify the driver.\\n\\nNow imagine if the woman in the very beginning did not have a driverless car. Who knows, the woman probably have gotten into a car crash because she was running late to work. Unsafe right? Now remeber, if the lady did have a driverless car, she would have been on time for work and she would have been on time for work safely.

       " \"Technology is the future, and with the advancement of technology comes the addition of responsibility for the people using it. One hundred and fifty years ago, we had a thriving textile industry, and the long awaited introduction of railroads and canals. Today, we are advancing with the hopes of creating a cost efficient self-driving vehicle that people from all reaches of the world can use. While this task may prove to be difficult, it is definitely a task that we should take on. Self-driving cars are a beneficial gateway to mastering concepts like artificial intelligence. Continuous experimentation with self-driving, or driverless cars will only prove to be benefical to humanity. I believe that the development of driverless cars will make driving safer, create opportunities in transportation, and lead on to greater advancments in technology.\\n\\nThink of a world where technology is what gets people from one location to another. One would get in their vehicle, speak or type in a few commands, and be on the way to their desired location. If scientists can master driverless cars, the road would be a much safer place. Driverless cars would make many less mistakes than the average human being. With the use of the advanced sensors, GPS, and radars that have been developed, cars will be able to communicate with one another and make decisions faster than any human. Every vehicle will be on a network communicating with one another, allowing for the safest and most efficient driving. The mental and physical aspects of humans play a huge role in driving conditions. A human's driving capabilities are hindered by mental and physical feelings like anger or fatigue. These feelings do not have an effect on driverless cars. Driverless cars can only make the road a safer and more efficient place, as they are able to communicate with one another and eliminate common human mistakes.\\n\\nDriverless cars are a stepping stone for greater transportation. With the developments of these technologies, improvements will be made in all aspects of transportation. Bus travel will become safer and more efficient. When this technology hits the world of aviation, planes and other aircraft will go beyond what they are today. Flying already uses extremely advanced technologies, but scientists can definitely push it to be better. When a well-made driverless car is developed, doors are opened for all types of transportation. Driverless cars will not only revolutionize all aspects of transportation, but it will also open doors in other areas of technology.\\n\\nWith the advancement of driverless cars, comes the eventual advancement of other technologies. The investment in the development of driverless cars will yield a great reward. Scientists will be able to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence, which plays a huge role in driverless cars. Artificial intelligence pushes for a greater future, as it allows for robots and alike technologies to complete tasks that would be difficult or time consuming for humans. Radars and sensors will also improve. People see radar technology in the weather, and GPS systems. With the advancements of radar technology, there will be a day when scientists can detect a tornado hours before it is going to touch down. At that point in time, there may even be technology to stop natural disasters.\\n\\nIn conclusion, driverless cars will take time to perfect, but driverless cars will be worth it when this perfection comes. There is a plethera of advantages that driverless cars bring to the table. They make the driving world a safer, and more efficient place. The technologies used in driverless cars also open doors to new types of technology. The benefits heavily outweigh the consequences when it comes to the development of driverless cars. When the world wanted to reach the stars, we did, so now let us reach for a technology that will make the world a better place.           \",\n",

       " 'Cell Phone Use While Driving\\n\\nIt has become a common practice today for many people to use their phones while driving. They try to be as efficient as possible with their time and see no problem with trying to multitask when operating a vehicle. Some text on their phones while others may take calls or check emails. In no regard is this a safe practice and drivers should not be allowed to use a phone under any circumstance as it only amount to a more dangerous driving environment.\\n\\nOften times crashes are the result of distracted driving. This usually occurs in teenage age groups who have a commitment to checking their phones while driving. Teenagers assume that by taking their eyes off of the road for solely two seconds, they aren\\'t putting themselves or anyone else in danger. In reality, distracted driving via cell phone use \"reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent,\" (\"Cell Phones\"). Taking calls or texting confidently reduces a driver\\'s ability to control a vehicle, respond to driving events, and direct attention to the roadway. This isn\\'t the case for just teenagers. These conditions apply to every driver who attempts to use their cell phone while driving, thus creating a dangerous driving environment. People often drive with family members, close friends, or children in the car. The chance of a fatal crash because of distracted driving is high and it is very possible that these family members, close friends, and children could be injured or worse. It is much safer to restrict all phone use while driving in order to ensure that roadways remain safe. By not using a cell phone, a driver is better able to pay attention, less likely to crash, and following the law (\"Cell Phones\").\\n\\nMany states have already offered consolation for the distracted driving problem in the United States. For instance, Georgia enacted Joshua\\'s Law in 2007 requiring 16 year old drivers to complete driver\\'s ed. The state also recently approved the Hands-Free law, which in essence eliminated any and all distracted driving practices. States recognize the problems that come with cell phone use while driving and have taken steps to fix them. This is evidence enough that in no way, shape, or form should drivers be allowed to use cell phones while operating a vehicle. For further support, there are about 9 people killed and 1,000 injured daily in the United States because of distracted driving (\"The Dangers of Distracted Driving\"), thus the popularity of cell phone use while driving is a damaging practice in the U.S. and should be ended immediately. Although cell phones may be used in a beneficial manner while driving, such as GPS use, crime reporting, or roadside assistance, it is a more viable and safe practice to prohibit its use until a person it not behind the wheel of a vehicle. A person only puts themselves in more danger, even when doing something appropriate with a cellphone when operating a vehicle, by trying to utilize it and maintain focus on the road at the same time.\\n\\nIn sum, it is in the most obvious interest of all drivers that cell phone use while driving be prohibited in any way or form. It is a dangerous practice that puts family, kids, and friends in immediate danger. Any benefits that are noted of cell phone use while driving are miniscule compared to the risk one takes by even looking at a phone for two seconds. Considering states have had enough common sense to begin a prohibition of the practice in favor of all drivers\\' safety, it is more than adequate to say that drivers should in no manner be given the opportunity to contribute a fatal driving environment by using a cell phone.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\n\"Cell Phones.\" Teen Driver Source, www. teendriversource. org/teen-crash-risks-prevention/distracted-driving/cell-phones.\\n\\n\"The Dangers of Distracted Driving.\" Federal Communications Commission, 10 May 2019, www. fcc. gov/consumers/guides/dangers-texting-while-driving.

Also, people should be able to make urgent calls here is three reasons why i think people shouldnt be able to use their cellphones because you can cause traffic collision. Also, it puts not only the driver in danger but other drivers also. Its also ilegal to be on the phone while your driving.

If you break a law their are always fines that you would have to pay so if its your first time breaking the hands-free law the fine is $50.00 the second time you break this law the fine will be $100.00.

Positive thinking is the practice of choosing to focus on the good rather than the bad in any situation and thereby engage with life more positively and productively.\\n\\nWhen we choose to focus on the good in a situation, our stress and anxiety levels tend to decrease. This can have a profound impact on our mental health and the ability to cope with challenging situations. Positive thinking can help us look at problems from a different perspective and push us to pursue solutions. This can also increase our emotional intelligence, which in turn can lead to better communication and relationships with those around us.\\n\\nFurthermore, positive thinking can bolster our self-confidence and encourage us to pursue opportunities for growth and advancement. Knowing that we can take on challenges, that we can push our limits and still come out on top, is a powerfuliumph of positivityhedge courage in our own capabilities and can be hugely motivational. Striving for success is so much easier when we’re not constantly putting ourselves down and expecting failure.\\n\\nUltimately, choosing to maintain a positive attitude is one of the most important steps we can take towards a successful life. To embrace the positivity potential within ourselves and our experiences is to open ourselves up to the possibility of a life full of growth and accomplishment.',\n",
       " \"Dear Principal,\\n\\nI think that the students in this school deserve to participate in school sports or other activities no matter the grades they have in school. I Think that the students should be able to play school sports and other activities no matter the grade they get because they should be able to have fun and play after a long day at school. I also think that it should be the parents decision if there kids have good enough grades to be able to play school sports and other activities. Some of the kids that go to this school cant help the grades they get it might not be there faults, they might have a disease like a A.D.D or something else that prevents them from reaching there full potential and not being able to learn like the other kids and i don't think that they should be punished when its not there faults. Also some kids might not have a way to get home after school and need to stay at an after school activity until there parents are able to pick them up and if they have under a B average and cant do after school activities then they will have no way of getting home. I hope that you will take my view of this into consideration, thank you.\\n\\nSincerely STUDENT_NAME.\",\n",
       " \"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student on the topic of leaving the decision of joining extracurricular activities up to students:\\n\\nHey, so like, I know some people think that schools should decide which extracurricular activities students can join, but I think it's way better if students get to decide for themselves. Here's why:\\n\\nFirst of all, students are like, way more interested in stuff they want to do, you know? If they don't want to join band, they're not gonna be all motivated to practice and stuff. But if they get to choose, they might be more into it and put more effort into it. Same with sports or clubs or whatever. They're more likely to stick with it if they get to pick.\\n\\nAnd it's not just about motivation. When students get to choose their own extracurriculars, they can find things that they're actually good at and enjoy. Like, I'm not super into sports, but I love writing and drawing. If I had to join a sports team, I would totally fail and hate it. But if I get to choose my own extracurriculars, I can do stuff that I'm actually good at and enjoy.\\n\\nAnother thing is, students might be more likely to try new things if they get to choose. Like, maybe they've never tried a certain activity before, but they're curious about it. If they get to choose, they can give it a shot and see if they like it. And if they don't like it, they can just switch to something else.\\n\\nBut, like, there are some cons too. One of them is that some students might not know what they want to do. Like, they might be really good at sports, but they might not know if they want to join a team or not. Or they might be really into music, but they might not know if they want to join a band or not. That can be tough.\\n\\nAnother con is that some students might not have the same opportunities. Like, some schools might not have as many extracurriculars to choose from, or they might not have any clubs that are really interesting to certain students. That can be unfair, you know?\",\n",

Deaths caused by car accidents, reckless, and drunk drivers would not be as high as they are now if we had driverless and smart cars. The amount of gas usage would not be as high as it is, becuase most people would not even need it. People would not have the stress of worrying about crashing into others cars or things. A car being a smart car, knowing when things are getting dangerous, and knowing not to crash into things would be also very beneficial for beginners and drivers who are paranoid about driving. Driverless and smart cars could really change the way the world works when it comes to cars.\\n\\nI think driverless cars would be safer for the world. When people die by car it is usually because of the reckless and drunk drivers behind the wheel. Now sometimes you can not control the way a person drives and also acccidents happen. With smart and driverless cars you have less things to worry about when it comes to things like accidents. I feel as if driverless cars would really help contribute to the stopping of all the unnecessary deaths cause by reckless and drunk drivers.\\n\\nIn 2013 BMW developed a car that was called a\\n\\n\" Traffic Jam Assistant \".

Even though the car did all of those things, it still notified the person behing the wheel when they needed to pay attention to the road ahead. I feel as if a car that is able to do that is wonderful and very beneficial to drivers and pedestrians. Being that people have already started developing these types of cars, I think that they should go on with making them better and safer for the world to have.\\n\\nDriverless and smart cars are things that just shows how well we have advanced with technology.

       " ' Ralph Waldo Emerson\\'s statement \"unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow\" is a widely debated topic among individuals. While some individuals agree with Emerson\\'s statement, others believe that people can grow in life without trying new things. However, I believe that people should try new things in order to grow and improve their lives.\\n\\nFirstly, trying new things can help individuals develop a higher level of self-confidence. When people step out of their comfort zones and try something new, they may experience fear or uncertainty. However, overcoming these challenges can lead to a boost in self-confidence. For example, if someone has never tried public speaking before but decides to give it a try, they may feel nervous at first. However, once they successfully deliver a speech, their confidence level may increase, leading them to feel more comfortable trying new things in the future.\\n\\nSecondly, trying new things can help individuals broaden their horizons and expand their knowledge. When people try new things, they may encounter new experiences, people, and cultures. These experiences can help individuals gain new perspectives and insights, which can be valuable in both their personal and professional lives. For example, if someone has never traveled outside of their country before but decides to take a trip abroad, they may encounter new customs, cuisines, and ways of life. These experiences can broaden their horizons and help them become more open-minded and adaptable.\\n\\nLastly, trying new things can help individuals feel more fulfilled and satisfied with their lives. When people try new things, they may discover new passions or interests that they never knew they had. These discoveries can bring joy and fulfillment to their lives, making them feel more satisfied and content. For example, if someone has never tried painting before but decides to take a class, they may discover a new hobby that brings them immense pleasure and satisfaction.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while some individuals may argue that people can grow in life without trying new things, I believe that trying new things is essential for personal growth and development. Trying new things can help individuals develop a higher level of self-confidence, broaden their horizons, and feel more fulfilled and satisfied with their lives. Therefore, I believe that Ralph Waldo Emerson\\'s statement \"unless you try to do something beyond',\n",

For the safety of freedom against tyranny and for the safety of the people\\'s sovreignty; the United States must ensure the continuity of the Electoral College.\\n\\nThe united states of america is the oldest surviving republic in modern day times. This is because our founding fathers were some of the greatest thinkers in american history. the idea of the electoral college was heavily influenced by the English system of government and also the Iriqouis Confederacy though it is usually unrecognized due to the fact that many americans, at the time, thought Native Americans were savages. One of the principles of English government the founding fathers used was the idea of electing heads of the nation. in the United Kingdom the Prime Minister, i. e. the head of government, was elected by the majority of the house of commons and then approval by some higher authority to ensure the vote was valid and legitimate. Our founding fathers were afraid of a popularly elected dictator who would bring down the principles of republicanism and democratic institutions. So the Founding Fathers decided to create a system where the head of state and his office where responsible and questionable to the Federal legislature; the United States Congress. He could be impeached by congress if he had committed crimes and removed from office if he was unfit to carry out the duties he was entrusted with. The electoral college was made to ensure that despotism never happens in the United States. Adolf Hitler was never elected to any office, he was appointed to the chancellorship of Germany by President Hindenburg because Hitler held the people\\'s trust and approval. Benito Mussolini was appointed Prime Minister of Italy by the King because he had the people on his side. This cannot happen in the United States because we have the Electoral College. the electors of the President are ordinary people that no one really knows whom they are. the electoral college is not democratic and it was not supposed to be. This is representative democracy or republicanism. According to Richard A. Posner,\"...the electoral college method is not democratic in a modern sense... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people.\"\\n\\nGovernments are flawed and some are so corrupt and abusive that their extremitites cannot be mentioned. The United States government and congress have always had the interests of the people in their mind. However, there is a rising faction of people of the united states that want to remove the electoral college, one of whom was Richard Milhouse Nixon who was the 37th president of the united states and was the only person to resign the office due to unconstitutional scandals. this growing faction states that because the Electoral College is not democratic enough that it should be done away with. According to Bradford Plumer,\"The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.\" What many forget to realize is that the Electoral College is a Presidium for the elections, it presides over and gives the real vote in the elections because it comprises of random people representing both the states and the states\\' populations. This is representation in the election process.\\n\\nThe Electoral College is the people\\'s representation. It was made by the Founding Fathers of the united States for a purpose. though many not approve of the Electoral College, many of our nation\\'s greatest presidents were elected by it like John F.

       " 'Dear State Senator,\\n\\nI am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and whether it should be kept or changed to an election by popular vote for the president of the United States. After carefully considering the information from multiple sources, I believe that the Electoral College should be kept in place. While there are valid arguments against it, such as those presented by Bradford Plumer in \"The Indefensible Electoral College,\" I find the points made by Judge Richard A. Posner in \"In Defense of the Electoral College\" to be more convincing.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of the Electoral College, as highlighted by Posner, is the certainty of outcome. While disputes over the outcome can still occur, they are less likely than in a direct popular vote system. This is because the winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. Additionally, the winner-take-all system in most states creates a landslide electoral vote victory for even a slight plurality in a state. This helps provide a clearer and more decisive outcome.\\n\\nAnother important factor in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the president has trans-regional appeal. As Posner explains, no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which means that candidates must appeal to a broader range of voters across different regions. This is crucial for a successful president, as it helps prevent a candidate with only regional appeal from being elected. It also ensures that residents from all regions feel represented and that their interests are taken into account.\\n\\nThe focus on swing states is another positive aspect of the Electoral College. Posner argues that the winner-take-all system incentivizes candidates to concentrate their campaign efforts on the states that are more evenly divided, known as swing states. These states receive more attention from candidates, which leads to a more engaged and informed electorate in these crucial states. This allows for a more thoughtful decision-making process and ensures that the most thoughtful voters have a greater influence on the outcome of the election.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also helps balance the influence of large and small states. As Posner points out, the mal-apportionment of the Senate in the Constitution gives more weight to small states in terms of representation. The Electoral College helps to restore some balance by providing larger states with more electoral votes. This means that presidential candidates must consider the interests and concerns of voters in both large and small states, preventing the majority from completely overshadowing the minority.\\n\\nFinally, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes. This is another advantage highlighted by Posner. In such cases, the Electoral College reliably produces a clear winner, reducing the need for additional elections and potential complications in the presidential election process.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while the arguments against the Electoral College presented by Bradford Plumer are valid, I believe that the advantages described by Judge Richard A. Posner outweigh the shortcomings. The Electoral College provides certainty of outcome, encourages candidates to appeal to a broader range of voters, ensures the representation of different regions, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. For these reasons, I strongly advocate for keeping the Electoral College in place.\\n\\nThank you for considering my perspective on this important matter.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n[Your Name]',\n",

If their grades are to low to do any sports then they need to at least a B to do sports and if they have lower then they will just have to try harder or do better next time. It might get more people to get better grades and maybe more students to join sports, but they might also not want to do sports because of their grades, and if they can't get better grades then they can't play. Many students want to do sports and many don't, and some just don't care. For the people that struggle with work and grades and all they get are C' s then they won't be able to do sports, and if you change the school's policy now they that might jeopardise other people that wanted to join sports from playing those sports and people that have worked their butt off to do these sports that now can't play because of their grades will mean that they did all that hard work for nothing, and that they will have to do something else that will suite them. So I don't know if it is such a great idea to change the policy and make it so you need at least a B maybe people will like the idea of it and maybe they won't but sometimes people go through with things that they disagree on and sometimes they like it after they do it and succeed then they'll think differently about your policy and they might still dislike it.

It is essential to pay attention to our own predictions and dreams, as they will ultimately guide us to our destiny.\\n\\nHowever, it can be challenging to reconcile our inner selves with the public personas we present to the world. If the gap between our inner selves and public personas is too wide, it can lead to personality disorders and a sense of disconnection from the world. To avoid this, it is crucial to cultivate the key aspects of our character traits and start acting in accordance with our true selves.\\n\\nOne way to do this is to start telling people about our aspirations and dreams and gradually begin to act on them. This will help us feel more comfortable in our own skin and attract like-minded people who can support and nurture our growth.\\n\\nAnother way to approach finding ourselves is to take a more proactive, less reflective approach. Life is not just about finding ourselves; it is about creating ourselves. We are like a blank slate waiting for someone to write our future. Instead of dwelling too much on ourselves and our past, we should focus on creating the future we want and take action towards achieving it.\\n\\nUltimately, being true to oneself is the greatest accomplishment, as it allows us to reduce anxiety and find a sense of fulfillment. No one can make us feel inferior without our consent, so we must embrace our true selves and have fun along the way. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, \"To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.\"',\n",
       " \"Arts education should definitely be essential for a well-rounded education. It's really important for kids to have the opportunity to express themselves and explore their creativity.\\n\\nFirst of all, arts education helps kids develop their critical thinking skills. When kids are creating art, they have to think about what they want to express, how they want to express it, and what materials they will use. This process helps them learn to analyze information, make decisions, and problem-solve.\\n\\nSecondly, arts education helps kids develop their self-confidence. When kids create something they are proud of, they feel good about themselves and their abilities. This can help them feel more confident in other subjects too, like math and science.\\n\\nThirdly, arts education can be a great way to learn about different cultures and histories. For example, by studying different types of music, kids can learn about different cultures and traditions. This can help them become more open-minded and understanding of people who are different from themselves.\\n\\nLastly, arts education can be a way to relax and reduce stress. Creating art can be a calming and enjoyable activity that helps kids unwind and express their emotions. This can be especially important for kids who may be struggling with anxiety or other mental health issues.\\n\\nIn conclusion, arts education should definitely be an essential part of a well-rounded education. It helps kids develop their critical thinking skills, self-confidence, cultural understanding, and can be a way to relax and reduce stress. All of these benefits make it an important subject that kids should have the opportunity to explore and enjoy.\",\n",

Another reason i will give you is that if you change the school policy ,instead of kids doing good things they will do bad things. My last and final reason is that students with out sports, because they have a \\'c\\', would really be sad because all teenage boys cant live without sports.\\n\\nIf you change school policies students will not have something to waste time in. They are not going to be cleaning the rooms, the kitchen, the stove, they are not going to be gardening.\\n\\nteenage boys live to play sports. It doesn\\'t matter the sport they will still be playing something.\\n\\nAnother reason I listed above is if students are not playing a sport what are they going to be doing? For all we know they can be out in the real world doing drugs. Maybe you will see them on the news \"have you seen this student? He has killed a young girl\"\\n\\nMy last an final reason is that a student with out sports that would be sad.

       " \"Dear Florida state senator, The Electoral College may seem like a great thing to have but I think it may not be the best idea. There are plenty of reasons and one of them is that it is kind of unfair that we really don't get to vote. We vote to see who is more popular with the people but if the Electoral College wants someone else, they can vote for the person they want. People think they are voting and no one else is making the decision for them but they are being lied to. It is an unfair way of voting and is is nondemocratic way in most people's eyes.\\n\\nAlthough, most of the time the voters get who they voted for, it happened to not be that way one time. In 2000, Gore had more popular votes than Bush but Bush won because he had more electoral votes and the people were angry. The Electoral College didn't go with what the voters wanted, but what they themselves wanted. People are being lied to that they have a say so in who should be president. Yes, most of the time they go with the voters but at any time they can disregard the popular votes and vote for who they want. If that's the case then no one should vote since they basically only have an opinion on who should be elected.\\n\\nI said it was a nondemocratic way before and it really is. It isn't really a free way of voting, we give an opinion and the Electoral College votes for whoever. It fits back when America was just becoming America, but it is too old now. When the Declaration of independence was made and a little while after that is what time era I think it should have died out. It is other people voting for us. In America, we have a voice, we can state opinions, we can vote too, but the Electoral College votes for us. It is telling our opinion, it is telling who we want, but why can't we have direct voting? It just isn't fair to the voters because they aren't really voting, just expressing an opinion.\\n\\nSpeaking of unfair, the number of electoral votes each state gets is outrageously unfair! Why is it based on the number of people in the state? Why can't people just vote directly and not have to worry about how many electoral votes they can get? For example, Florida has 29, Texas has 38, and california has 55. They are all big numbers and they can easily make a huge impact on who becomes president. The less populated states on the other hand, don't really do much justice. Maine has 4, Hawaii has 4, and Alaska has 3. It seems really unfair to those states because they have a small chance of actually making any sort of dent in the numbers. Alaska's numbers compared to California's numbers is just really unfair. If people were able to vote directly, then it would be fair game for the states with fewer electoral votes.\\n\\nIn the end, people know the Electoral College is an unfair way of voting. People are lied to about being able to vote because it is not direct because it is the Electoral College decides anyway. The state numbers are really unfair, it is a nondemocratic way of voting, and people think it is way out of date. If the Electoral College were to trade spots with the voters who aren't in it, I'm sure they'd say that it is really unfair. People don't really get to vote, if anything, there should be direct voting like most people believe there is. It would be more fair for states like Alaska and all the other states with really small numbers. I'm sure it is easy to keep track of the numbers with electoral votes, but yet like I said, it is really unfair for the smaller populated states.\",\n",
       " 'Hi, fellow citizens! Today, I want to talk to you about the advantages of limiting car usage. I know it might seem like a weird idea at first, but bear with me and let me show you some cool things I learned from reading a bunch of passages about it.\\n\\nFirst of all, did you know that cars are one of the biggest polluters in our environment? Like, they release all sorts of bad stuff into the air, like carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, which can cause serious health problems for us and our planet. By limiting car usage, we can reduce the amount of pollution in the air, which can help prevent things like asthma and other breathing problems. Plus, it\\'ll help keep our planet healthy for longer!\\n\\nAnother thing I learned is that cars are a major contributor to traffic congestion. Like, have you ever been stuck in a traffic jam and been like, \"Ugh, why is this taking forever?!\"? Yeah, that\\'s because of all the cars on the road. By limiting car usage, we can reduce the number of cars on the road, which can help traffic move faster and more smoothly. Plus, it\\'ll be easier to get around without having to sit in traffic for hours.\\n\\nBut that\\'s not all! Limiting car usage can also help us save money. Like, think about it - cars are expensive, right? They cost a lot of money to buy, maintain, and fuel up. By using public transportation or biking or walking instead, we can save a bunch of money on fuel and maintenance costs. Plus, we can use that money for other things, like, I don\\'t know, buying ice cream or something!\\n\\nAnd finally, limiting car usage can help us live healthier lives. Like, when we use public transportation or bike or walk, we get exercise, which is good for our bodies and minds. And when we\\'re not stuck in cars all the time, we can enjoy the fresh air and sunshine, which can boost our moods and energy levels. Plus, it\\'ll be easier to get around without having to worry about parking or getting lost.\\n\\nSo, as you can see, there are lots of advantages to limiting car usage. It\\'s not only good for the environment, but it\\'s also good for our health, our wallets, and our overall quality of life. So, let\\'s try to use cars less often and find other ways to get around, like public transportation, biking, or walking. It might take some getting used to, but trust me, it\\'ll be worth it in the long run! Thanks for reading, fellow citizens!',\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nI think there pros and more cons in driving and using your Cell phone is unacceptable. But I'm in the side of not using your phone while driving. Because you're supposed to keep all your attention in driving and in the road all times. Texting and driving can kill in split seconds-just the amount of time it takes to send a quick text message. Cell phones cause many distractions, there are numerous amounts of risks while texting behind the wheel and it slows down your reaction time. Therefore its very dangerous using your phone and operating a vehicle be at the same time. Because anything can happen in any moment you can get in a harsh accident just by texting someone or just picking up or phone in general.\\n\\nCognitive distractors are anything that takes your mind off the road like engaging in a conversation via text or talking on the phone, or trying to operate your navigating system while route. And lastly, manual distractions which are any distractors causing you to take your hands off the wheel such as reaching for your phone to send that quick text.\\n\\nIf you are texting and driving it's not a good idea unless if it's something extremely important for an example like important call very important and you need to know what it is or an important text that is necessary to know. Simply because someone feels like they must respond to a text immediately is why many of the accidents occur and most of the time this lead to a vehicular accident that can result in death.\\n\\nTeens to the ages 16 and 18 are using their phones and driving they are getting find by the police. The find cost about $500 to $800 just because they were texting and driving. Many people think they're not a problem with texting and driving I feel everyone has the responsibility to put the phone down and keep your eyes on the road and drive safely.                                   \",\n",

       " \"Dear Principle,\\n\\nDue to the recent fascination with cell phones and all the new technology, I can definitely see why you need the change in policy. You see, allowing cell phones as long as they are turned off for class and the ability to use them for free times, helps make a connection with your students. No one wants a principle that is too controlling, as in Policy 2, and you can't have students' cell phones ring all the time because it's distracting to the learning environment. That's why Policy 1 is a great compromise and a choice that benefits both sides.\\n\\nIf you did take cell phones away, you would create an awful tension between you and your students. People would be angry that one of their rights was taken away in a matter of seconds. What used to be acceptance would become anger and resistance. By banning cell phones you would make it seem as if bringing your cell phone would make you more of a rebel. Either way, this new policy would make students even more inclined to bring their cell phones.\\n\\nNow let's say you picked Policy 1. People don't like change, but this time it isn't so big, which therefore means that people would be willing to accept it. By doing this you don't seem like a dictator and it's not pure chaos so this is an amazing choice that would create a bond of understanding. Not everyone is understanding as you may wish, but think of it as a life lesson for the students. Life isn't perfect. People just have to deal with that.\\n\\nYou may seem reluctant to this new age of technology and allowing cell phones but the truth is cell phones aren't all bad. I personally know many students that use there phone to get the homework assignments they missed or a calculator or even to check the time! When you are sick you need to call someone to get the homework. If you banned cell phones from school, it would take a lot longer to get the assignments. It's true that we also play games on our phones but it's to escape the shackles of society every once in a while.\\n\\nPolicy 1 is the best choice. It creates a compromise between your students that is fair. Students would agree that this is the best choice by far. Whether they like it or not, this is a choice and people will accept that. It's not to big of a difference either. People will adjust and life will go on. It's a choice that benefits both sides. These are the reasons you should pick Policy #1.\\n\\nSincerely, A student of yours\",\n",
       " 'Sure, here\\'s my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average 8th grade student:\\n\\nDetermine Never to be Idle: Agree or Disagree?\\n\\nThomas Jefferson once said, \"Determine never to be idle. No matter how busily occupied, find time for something useful.\" As an 8th grader, I think this quote is really important because it reminds me that I should always be striving to do something productive, whether it\\'s in school or outside of it.\\n\\nI definitely agree with Jefferson that being active is key to accomplishing more and building my future. When I\\'m not lazy and actively working towards my goals, I feel more motivated and confident.

It\\'s also taught me the importance of responsibility and hard work, which are skills that will help me in all areas of my life.\\n\\nBut I also think it\\'s important to be responsible and not just do things for the sake of doing them. If I\\'m not careful, I can get caught up in busywork and forget to take breaks and relax. It\\'s important to find a balance between being active and being idle, because if I\\'m always going nonstop without taking time for myself, I can burn out and lose motivation.\\n\\nAnother reason why it\\'s necessary to be responsible is because if I choose to be idle, bad things can happen. For example, if I don\\'t stay on top of my schoolwork, I might fall behind and struggle to catch up. Or if I don\\'t take care of my responsibilities at home, like cleaning my room or helping with chores, my family might get upset with me. It\\'s important to be responsible so that I can avoid these kinds of problems and maintain good relationships with the people around me.\\n\\nFinally, I don\\'t think it\\'s ever better to do nothing. Sure, it can be nice to take a break and relax every once in a while, but if I\\'m not doing anything productive, I feel like I\\'m wasting time.

       " \" From my perspective, I believe that it is unlikely to change someone's initial impression of you, as there are several factors that make it difficult to do so. People tend to form their first impressions quickly and based on limited information, which can be difficult to alter.\\n\\nFor example, when I went to a networking event a few years ago, I was meeting a lot of new people from different backgrounds. Despite my best efforts to make a good impression, I could tell that some people had already formed their opinions of me before I even had a chance to speak with them.\\n\\nEven after I had the opportunity to interact with these individuals and demonstrate my skills and abilities, their initial impressions seemed to remain unchanged. It was frustrating, as I knew that I was capable of doing a great job, but it seemed like people were not willing to give me a chance to prove myself.\\n\\nIn my experience, people's initial impressions can be difficult to change, regardless of whether they are positive or negative. It takes time and effort to build a relationship and establish trust, and it can be challenging to overcome someone's preconceived notions about you.\\n\\nOf course, there are some situations where it may be possible to change someone's initial impression, such as when you have a lot of time and opportunities to interact with them and demonstrate your value. However, in many cases, it may be more effective to focus on building a strong relationship and showing your true abilities rather than trying to change someone's initial impression.\",\n",

Through the right friendships and relationships, both parties come to know each other, understand each other’s good and bad habits, and support each other in times of difficulty.

However, if they're principal takes that privilege\\xa0away from them, they're after-school routine may change. Instead of having time to complete assignments, students may feel rushed to finish now that their extra time away from them. Schools should not require their students to take an extracurricular activity due to students not having time to commit to the activity, and because their stress levels may increase.\\n\\nStudents also might not be able to fully commit to an extracurricular activity because of their lack of time to do so. Students may already have an after-school activity that is not part of the school's extracurricular program. Some students actually need to stay home, not just to relax, but for their family. For instance, a student might need to stay home and watch over their younger sibling. Students should have a life out of school as well, and not be stuck in school every weekday. Extracurriculars, being mandatory, act as an obstacle in student's daily life. When students are out of school, they should use their extra time on things they want to do, not just things they have to do.\\n\\nBeing required to do extracurricular activities will also increases student's stress levels. Schoolwork is already very difficult for students by itself, why should they add on to this stress? Students need time after school to catch up on work, and what's keeping them from doing this? The mandatory extracurricular activities. Due to this amount of stress, student's may not get the chance to finish their work.

After-school activities block the chance for a student to actually live life out of school. School is very long and stressful, and students don't need added stress.

On the other hand, a negative mindset can lead to a lack of motivation, self-doubt, and ultimately, failure.\\n\\nFirstly, having a positive attitude allows individuals to focus on the possibilities and opportunities that lie ahead. When faced with challenges or obstacles, a positive mindset enables individuals to view them as opportunities for growth and learning. This approach leads to a greater willingness to take risks and embrace new experiences, ultimately leading to greater success.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a negative mindset can lead to a lack of motivation and self-doubt. Individuals with a negative mindset may view challenges as insurmountable and may give up before even attempting to overcome them. This mindset can lead to a lack of progress and ultimately, failure.\\n\\nFurthermore, a negative mindset can have significant consequences in both personal and professional settings. In personal relationships, a negative mindset can lead to a lack of trust, communication, and ultimately, a breakdown in relationships. In professional settings, a negative mindset can lead to a lack of productivity, creativity, and ultimately, job loss.\\n\\nOn the other hand, maintaining a positive attitude can lead to numerous benefits. A positive mindset can lead to increased motivation, self-confidence, and a greater sense of purpose. This approach can lead to greater success in both personal and professional settings. Additionally, a positive mindset can lead to better mental and physical health, leading to a greater quality of life.\\n\\nIn conclusion, having a positive attitude is essential to achieving success in life. A positive mindset allows individuals to approach challenges with optimism and resilience, leading to greater outcomes. On the other hand, a negative mindset can lead to a lack of motivation, self-doubt, and ultimately, failure. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain a positive attitude in order to achieve success in life.',\n",
       " 'Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,\\n\\nMy name is STUDENT_NAME and I am a student here at SCHOOL_NAME. I agree with what you are doing to the school policy. An education is important for future life. It is more important than playing sports for your school. If a student wants to play sports, he should have at least a B- average. What happens if you end up getting kicked out of the sport and are forced to get a job. Most of the good paying jobs won\\'t accept you without a certain degree whether it be bachelors or doctorates. You need the grades for the high paying jobs. Colleges usually review your grades before they let you play on their team and let you attend their college.\\n\\nIf the student really wants to play on the school team, then s/he should be taking his/her grades and education seriously. Until s/he is in college that student should have to get at least B averages. Let him/her get on the team even if his/her grade is 3 points under a B, but make him/her get his/her grades up or s/he gets cut off the team. If s/he doesn\\'t have a B average come the semi- championships/championship games, s/he gets benched. Even if s/he is the best player on the team. That way there is some incentive to keep the grades up- or get them up.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe you are doing the right thing by changing the school policy. Allow the student to play if s/he has at least a 77 grade average but make him/her get that grade up to an 80 average before the \"big game\". And you are probably thinking oh he is just a kid that doesn\\'t play sports for the team. But the truth is I did run on the SCHOOL_NAME Track team so I know what those \"big games\" are like. When you get booted off the team- I didn\\'t: my mom took me out because I didn\\'t keep up with chores- it doesn\\'t feel \"cool\". You think \"I could have helped the team win\" and you start feeling down or mad. Either way- this isn\\'t a personal paper-\\n\\nI believe that you are doing the right thing for the students and school alike- even if they don\\'t like it.',\n",
       " 'Benefits Without a Car\\n\\nCould you imagine your life without a car? It seems impossible if cars wouldn\\'t exist. Did you know that there are cities where people have\\'nt used their cars for a whole day? While in others people dont ever use cars. People think that without a car they\\'re nothing, and that life is totally different. But there is something very interesting happening around us, in other countries which is the reason why they\\'ve stopped using cars for a while. The polluted air due to cars in doing no good for us. Think about it, maybe you could might live without are car for a day for an important cause.\\n\\nFirst thing first, we should learn how people live in other countries without a car. It sounds weird to us, but it\\'s something normal for them. There is forbidden to have home garages and to park cars on street in Vauban, Germany. According to Elizabeth Rosenthal, Vauban, Germany has gone from a city with cars to people giving up their cars. \"street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders\"(Rosenthal, paragraph 2). This place is \"car free\" except for the downtown area and a few streets of the community. She also states that other countries like the US experiments more problems in pollution.\"passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50%\\n\\nin some car-intensive areas in the US\"(5). People walk way more in Europe, they dont suffer much from air pollution.\\n\\nAdditionally, Paris has enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. These cities have stopped using their cars for a while to help calm the air pollution. \"On Monday motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31)\" (Robert Duffer, paragraph 11). Although that people were not supposed to us ehtier cars that day, 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters. The cause for not driving for that day was because the cold nights and warm days caused the air to trap car emissions. Another reason for car free in Paris is because of the micrograms found. \"Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.9 in London, Rueters found\"(Duffer, 17). Its an advantage to prevent car usage because the smog is clearing in these cities.\\n\\nIn similarity, millions of Colombians hiked, walked and did many other activities without touching a car to prevent the smog. These cities are working together to make the world a better place. \"In a program that set\\'s to spread to toher countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday\"(Andrew Selsky, paragraph 20). The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, and they achived it. That day without a car was an improvement camapign in Bogota. Surprsingly, in the US recent studies have stated that Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less each year that goes by. \"if the pattern persists- and many sociologists believ it will- it will have beneficial implications for carbon emmisions and the environment\"(Elizabrth Rosenthal, paragarph 34). There has also been changes in the US. Driving less has stopped air pollution.\\n\\nIn conclusion there are benefits without a car. Benefits for the world around us, and well you might get some stress out if you start walking, hiking, or riding bycicles for a while. It\\'s incredible just to think of the idea that many countries have stopped driving for a day to make their country or city a better place. While in cities like Vauban, Germany people live without cars. Thats what makes their city different. Even though they do also let these things happen for a right cause. I think that we could live without a car for one day, it\\'s not a big deal, really. It\\'s to make the US a better place.    ',\n",

       " 'Ralph Waldo Emerson famously stated, \"To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.\" The idea of individualism has been embedded in our society since the dawn of time. In today\\'s fast-paced world, it is often easy to get lost in the collection of society\\'s norms and expectations. However, having the freedom to think and act without the fear of judgment can be beneficial both in and out of the workplace. \\n\\nIndividuals have the power to create their own unique style of work that will lead to success. This allows them to take control of their lives and figure out how to reach their goals in the best way possible. Meanwhile, selflessness involves serving and helping others; it has different implications from expressing one\\'s individuality. The former requires the individual to put others first, while the latter is all about taking the initiative to live life according to one\\'s own beliefs and values. \\n\\nIn the future, we could expect to see individualism being used as a form of resistance and as a tool for self-expression. As the world continues to become more diverse and inclusive, individuals who practice individualism will be better equipped and empowered to challenge the status quo. This could open up new realms of opportunities for people that were previously out of reach. Individuality may be the key to unlocking a bright and successful future.',\n",

Just like how we need privacy in our own lives, kids need privacy too. They should be able to make mistakes and learn from them without their parents always looking over their shoulders.\\n\\nAnother reason is that its not good for the parents either. They might get too stressed out if they see their kids arent doing well. They might start yelling at them and that could make the kid feel bad. It could also make the parent feel bad too. Its just not a good situation.\\n\\nAlso, kids need to learn how to be responsible for themselves. If their parents are always checking up on them, they wont learn how to do things on their own. They wont know how to problem solve or how to be independent. Thats important for when they grow up and have to take care of themselves.\\n\\nFurthermore, sometimes kids need a break from their parents. They need to be able to make their own choices and learn from their mistakes. If their parents are always watching, they wont be able to do that. They wont be able to grow up and be their own person.\\n\\nIn conclusion, parents should not be able to monitor their kids grades and attendance online.

It would be helpful to have a clear introduction, body, and conclusion.\\n2. Sentence structure: Some of your sentences are quite long and hard to follow. Try breaking them up into shorter, simpler sentences.\\n3. Spelling and grammar: While it\\'s understandable that a grade 6 student may make spelling and grammar mistakes, it\\'s important to proofread your work carefully to catch any errors. For example, \"they need privacy\" should be \"they need privacy too\" and \"they wont be able to do that\" should be \"they won\\'t be able to do that.\"\\n4. Use of examples: While you provide some examples to support your arguments, they are quite general and don\\'t fully illustrate your points.

       " 'Based on the four sources, car usage should be limited in some way. Smog in Paris and other cities have governments placing restrictions on when and where citizens are allowed to drive their vehicles. A German has a certain city that bans cars and other places, such as Bogota, Columbia, have \"car free days\". These give citizens of nearly every country a thought of why drive when i can walk. Some expert sociologists even believe we are out of our peak car buying years and into one that is less vehicle extemsive and more stress free and relaxed.\\n\\nIn Paris, smog forced many citizens to stop their driving all together. The pollution was so overwhelming that it rivaled Beijing, one of the most polluted cities on the world (Duffer). Car emissions put Paris\\' parculate matter scale off of the charts. Pullotion is a serious issue, especially when it affects millions, such as those in Paris. Other places have gone so extreme to ban cars in certain cities. Vauban, Germany have given up their cars to live there. Most citizens agree with Heidrum Walter\\'s words of \"being much happier [without a car]\" (Rosenthal). Her understanding of a life without a vehicle is a crutial turning point in todays society and even limit air pollutions, not unlike those of Paris or Bejing.\\n\\nExperts say that the United States \"love affair for vehicles seems to be cooling\" (Rosenthal). Many Young citizens aged under 25 seem to have no desire for a drivers license. As of April 13, 2013, the number of miles driven per person were down 9 percent from the peak of car buying sales. We are experiencing a long term cultural shift (Rosenthal) and will likely see dramtic changes in the future. Major cities , like New York and San Fransico, have transit and subway systems put into place for this very reason. More car pooling and public transit seems to be the way to go.\\n\\nNot only does driving less reduce air pollution, but it decreases unwanted stress in many different situations. Many cities and countries around the globe agree with this and are all headed that direction. Vehicles seem do be on the downhill portion pf their lifespan. Take the initiative and protect our world. Less driving and less pollution reduces stress in even the best of us.    ',\n",

These behaviors can range from small white lies to more serious actions, such as cheating or lying on a resume. While it is important to be honest and trustworthy, there are times when first impressions can be misleading.\\n\\nFor example, a job interviewer may be impressed by a candidate's appearance or their ability to speak confidently, even if their qualifications are not as strong as other candidates. In this case, the candidate may use deceptive behaviors, such as exaggerating their experience or skills, to further impress the interviewer. While this may lead to a job offer, it can also lead to negative consequences down the line.\\n\\nOn the other hand, there are times when first impressions can be accurate. For example, if a person is consistently rude or disrespectful to others, it is likely that they will continue to behave this way in the future. In this case, it is important to use first impressions to make informed decisions about whether or not to interact with the person further.\\n\\nWhen it comes to getting a job, it is important to be honest and straightforward in your application materials. While it may be tempting to exaggerate your qualifications or experience, this can lead to negative consequences down the line. Instead, focus on highlighting your strengths and qualifications in a clear and concise manner.\\n\\nPeople may change their behavior in order to impress others for a variety of reasons. Some people may do this because they want to fit in with a particular group or because they want to be seen as successful or accomplished. Others may do this because they want to avoid conflict or because they want to be liked or admired.\\n\\nHowever, it is important to remember that people are not always who they seem to be. While it may be tempting to judge someone based on their behavior, it is important to consider other factors as well, such as their background and experiences.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while deceptive behaviors can be tempting, it is important to be honest and straightforward in all aspects of our lives.

       " \"Have you ever needed advice? Most people have to ask other people for different opinions at many points in their lives. When someone wants advice, they may talk to multiple people instead of just one. When more than one person is asked, these people will usually have differing opinions. It is important to seek multiple opinions when looking for advice because people with different experiences may have different ideas, one might not feel comfortable with their first option, and one can combine the ideas of others to come up with their own plan.\\n\\nA good reason to look for more than one opinion is that people with different pasts lead will believe different things. Often, no two people in a room will have the same experiences or ideas, so asking more than one person allows one to weigh these opinions and choose the best option for their situation. For example, a man who grew up with multiple rowdy older brothers and a woman who had no siblings might have different ideas on how to handle a disagreement between friends. Their experiences had led them to believe different things, but that does not mean that either one was wrong. They just grew up learning different ways to manage situations, leading to them giving different advice. If someone asks multiple people the same question, they are likely to find different ideas from people with different backgrounds.\\n\\nA different reason to get advice from multiple people is that one's first option might not feel right for them. Different people have differing personalities, and what one feels like they could do may not seem feasible for another. One example of this is if a shy, studious, and introverted boy asks for advice from his boisterous, popular, and sporty older sister on how to stand up for himself. If the sister tells him to do something such as loudly tell the bully to stop and then walk away, the boy might have been better served by asking his mother, who also would prefer to be quiet and not bothered by other people. In this example, the boy would not have been served well by using his sister's idea because he would not have felt like he could pull it off. Through getting more than one opinion, one can find a solution that matches what they might be able to do, not just what might work for someone else.\\n\\nLastly, one should get advice from more than one person because they can build their own solution based on parts of the suggestions of other people. When people combine the ideas of others, it can often lead to a plan that is more thought out than it would otherwise be. An example of this principle is if a boy asks his mother and father how to talk to his teacher about an incorrect grade. If his mother tells him to schedule a time to explain the situation and his father says that he should bring in the assignment and show the teacher without notice, he could take the best parts of both and schedule a time to meet while also coming in with the materials to show the teacher exactly what was going on. Once he had gotten multiple ideas, he was able to put them together and make a stronger plan. This is always a possibility if one uses the opinions of many people, rather than just one.\\n\\nPeople need to look for multiple sources of advice because different ideas come from people with different backgrounds, some people may not feel able to use the first option given to them, and others' ideas can be put together to make a new, stronger idea. If people who grew up in different countries all give advice on the same topic, the one asking can see a diverse range of ideas. The first person to answer may have had advice that disagreed with the asker's beliefs, but they are able to move on to a new person. Afterwards, the asker can take all of the advice that they were given and cobble together their own idea based on what they had heard. All in all, there are many reasons that one should take many people's answers when they are asking for advice.\",\n",

First impressions can set the tone for the whole relationship, so it's important to make a good one.\\n\\nChanging for Attention:\\n\\nSometimes, people will change who they are just to get attention from others.

Don't try to be someone you're not, because the interviewer will probably find out. And if you get the job, you'll have to keep up the act the whole time you're working there. That's no fun. It's better to just be yourself and show the interviewer how great you are at what you do.\\n\\nFeeling Left Out:\\n\\nSometimes, people will change who they are just to avoid feeling left out. Like, if someone is not invited to a party, they might start acting differently around their friends to make them think they'\",\n",
       " 'An electoral College compromises between election of the president by vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The electoral College consists of 538 electors, a majority of 270 electoral votes is requires to elect the president. This presidential election is held every 4 years on the tuesday after the first monday in November. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors andare chosen by the candidates political part.\\n\\nPersonally Ibelieve that the presidential election should be based on popular votebecause as citizens of the United States we should be able to help the output of what our futures will look like and be able to choose who we want to lead us. Whichever candidate gets the most votes wins and they become the new president of the United States. Not that Electoral college is all bad its just when you vote you vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president of their choice.\\n\\nCitizens would be more likely to vote for their present if they felt like their vote would actually matter and have an effect on who the future president will be. People are less likely to participate or care if they feel like their vote doesn matter and is taken up and not counted. If people knew that it was over popular vote that will decide the future president then they\\'re going to vote more and be more active when stuff like this takes place because they feel like their vote actually matters and is making a difference.\\n\\nElectoral College is unfair to voters because \"winnertakeall system\" in each state.\\n\\nCandidates dont spend much time trying to win the votes of a state they think isnt going to help them in the long run by winning. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all. This included Rhode Island, South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt see a single campaign ad. Electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.\\n\\nBob Dole once said \"electoral college should be abolished\" and from the looks of it he\\'s notwrong. Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter, the U.S. chamber of commerce, and the AFLCIO arestanding with Dole on this accusation andbothagree on aboloishing this act. A Gallup poll was taken in 2000 and won the popular vote but lost the presidency. Over 60 percent of voters would perfer direct election over the kind we have now which is Electoral College.',\n",

First impressions not always are positive for our-selfs, it can make you doubt about your-self, look for people's approval, and get a low-esteem. First impression not always come into your life with good intentions.\\n\\nAs first point, first impressions make you overthink what to do and what to say, making you doubt about your-self, and loosing your confidence.

These \"Cowboys\" helped haul animals across the ocean to help with their food supply. Once Luke Bomberger had hauled \"335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.\" It\\'s an amazing experience that many people would love.\\n\\nFirst of all, being on board across the ocean meant ways to pass time. \"Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animnals had been housed.

       " 'Winston Churchill famously said that \"success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.\" Indeed, failure is an integral part of the pursuit of success, and understanding why is essential to maximizing your potential. Not many people are a failure of their success because, with the right approach, failure can be used to inform our decisions and propel us to heights we would never have achieved without it. \\n\\nThe first example of why not many people are a failure of their success is perseverance. The individuals who refuse to give up in the face of adversity are the ones who can achieve great things. Thomas Edison failed more than 1,000 times in his pursuit of the right combination of materials to make a reliable and durable light bulb, yet he kept trying until he achieved his goal. His ability to persevere through failure was the key to success in the end. \\n\\nThe second example of why not many people are a failure of their success is resilience. Those who can stay focused when under pressure, avoid giving up, and keep their vision alive will eventually be rewarded. For example, when Steve Jobs was fired from Apple in 1985, he had to start over from scratch. After all the failure and setbacks, he eventually returned to build one of the most successful companies in the world. \\n\\nMany people are also inspired by what they are going, and using failure as an opportunity to learn and grow can be especially empowering. Every time we fail, we get a chance to re-evaluate and adjust our strategies, develop new skills, and become more knowledgeable and determined. For instance, after Oprah Winfrey was fired from her television job at the age of 22, she used the experience to her advantage. She was determined to make something out of the failure and learn from it, and that’s exactly what she did. \\n\\nFinally, many people are drawn to failure because it provides a sense of achievement. Facing failure is not easy, but it encourages us to reach beyond our comfort zone and accomplish something extraordinary. Consider Amelia Earhart, who wanted to make history and become the first female pilot to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. She accepted failure as part of the process, and used her courage and determination to make her dream come true. \\n\\nIn conclusion, failure can play an important role in the pursuit of success, if we choose to take advantage of it. By being resilient, inspired, and',\n",
       " 'The Face On Mars\\n\\nHave you ever seen something crazy on something, maybe a face or something that you seen before? Have you thought about how that face or something else has gotten there? Well, for a start it defintley wasn\\'t aliens! Just like the face on mars, people belive that the face was created by aliens! But that isn\\'t true, the face on mars is just and only a natural landform that some how was created on earth.\\n\\nFor my first reason on why the face on Mars is just a natural landform is because NASA later revelied that the face was not made of aliens, but by shadows. A few days after that image was found, NASA needed to take a look and figure out what made this incredible and scientififc picture so unique, and why and how it was formed. Later on, they have came up with an good explaination about this unique image. NASA said this,\"huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" Scientifically, the face was made from a natural cause, so it makes it a very different natural landform.\\n\\nNow, for my second reason on why this was not made by aliens, but just a natural landform is that there is no scientific research showing that aliens do exist and created this face. Now I do know that some people say that they have seen aliens, but scientists dont think that is one hundred percent true because they don\\'t have any evidence suggesting that aliens are real. Many people to belive in them, but how do we know that they are actually real without any scientific knowledge? But now after NASA did some research, they found out that even though we don\\'t have information about them, aliens did not create that face, it was only a natural landform.\\n\\nFor my third and final reason, why the face was not created by aliens and is only a natural landform , is because in the last paragraph,paragraph twelve, they talk about how the the picture actually shows that it is the Martian equvialent of a butte or mesa. Since the landform shows a butte or mesa, that means that the image was a major landform that came from the American West. Garvin says, \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\" He also said,\" That\\'s a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" So, this is not only a natural landform, but a major natural landform.\\n\\nI do agree a little bit about aliens creating the face. Maybesomewhere in space, there are aliens that created something else or not. One day maybe we can find something out in space that has something to do with aliens, but today is just isn\\'t the day to do that. But overall, i would have to agree that aliens did not create this, but this is only a natural landform created by something other than aliens.\\n\\nAs you can see, this creative landform was most defintley not created from aliens, but just a nice natural landform. Scientists now figured out that this \"Face on Mars\" is from shadows and not from aliens. This landform is actually a butte or a mesa which is very intersting to have found out. Many people did belive that the \"Face on Mars\" was created by aliens, but scientists haven\\'t found out if there are aliens or not, so we shouldn\\'t jump into conclusion. But overall, this face was defintely a landform and not created by aliens!!',\n",
       " \"Hey, Mrs. Johnson! Here's my essay on the advantages and disadvantages of learning in a classroom setting and in a home setting.\\n\\nLearning in a classroom setting has its perks, but it also has its downsides. One advantage of learning in a classroom is that you get to learn from a teacher who is an expert in the subject matter. They can provide structured lessons and activities that are tailored to your needs, which can help you learn more effectively. Plus, you get to interact with other students and learn from their perspectives, which can be really cool.\\n\\nOn the other hand, learning in a classroom can also be kind of boring sometimes. You have to sit in one place for a long time, and you might not be able to ask questions or explore topics that interest you. And let's be real, sometimes the teacher can be really boring or hard to understand. Plus, you might not have as much freedom to learn at your own pace as you would in a home setting.\\n\\nLearning in a home setting, on the other hand, can be really convenient. You can learn whenever and wherever you want, as long as you have access to the internet or books. You can also learn at your own pace, which can be really helpful if you're a visual learner or if you need more time to understand something. And let's not forget, you don't have to worry about getting up early or dealing with traffic to get to school!\\n\\nBut there are also some downsides to learning in a home setting. For one thing, you might not have as much structure or accountability as you would in a classroom. It can be easy to get distracted or lose motivation when you're learning on your own. And let's be real, sometimes you might not have access to the same quality of resources or support as you would in a classroom.\\n\\nOverall, I think the best way to learn is probably a combination of both classroom and home setting. That way, you can get the structure and support of a classroom, while also having the freedom and flexibility to learn at your own pace. Plus, you can always use the internet or books to supplement your learning and explore topics that interest you.\\n\\nSo, that's my essay!\",\n",

For heaven sakes sometimes when driving legs, fingers, or other body parts can cramp up! Say good-bye to cars that require to have a human driver at all times, and say aloha to driverless cars! Driverless cars have pros like GPS navigation and they provide more safety for the people, but cons such as weather conditions or technical errors.\\n\\nFor the old folks, looking back into history television and cell phones were major and exciting changes. So now the young generation wonders what the next big thing will be. Driverless cars will perhaps be the next big thing? To me this is a fabulous and efficient idea! Personally, I dont know how many times someone has asked me for directions. My headache finally has come to an end! With driverless cars there is a built in GPS reciever using google if I recall back to the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming.\" Nobody will ever need help on how to get somewhere. Just tell them the place and time and the cars will get you there possibly without a humans help the whole car ride.\\n\\n\"Safety first!\" is what they say now days. Watch for road signs and don\\'t run the stop sign is commonly heard. Sometimes, when you go out late at night to a party, you have to watch for drunk drivers and be aware. Driverless cars have everyone covered. If everyone had a driverless car, the cars have the roads signs programmed in them. The drunk driver\\'s wouldn\\'t be the ones driving because the computer will. Many people often get tickets because they disobey roads signs and break the speed limit. How can you get in trouble for something you didn\\'t do. Why don\\'t we just add on the fact this will help you save money too! Man, just like McDonalds \"Im lovin\\' it!\"\\n\\nSome people will obviously be against the idea of driverless cars. The \"haters\" can\\'t dull the shine of such a magnificent idea. I can\\'t dull the fact that their conterarguments are something to consider. The weather is a great example. In some environments snow and rain can cause wrecks if the car is not somehow modified that the roads are bad. I suggest four wheel drive on all driverless cars. Another con is the fact that we are relying on technology. What if technology fails or the computer system goes wrong. Can we live with such uncertainty? Spare ourselfs the time to review and fix today to die tomorrow in a possible wreck due to this fear. By 2020 hopefully as they said, these cons will be reviewed and more reliable by then!\\n\\nAloha to driverless cars! The cars sound like a spectacular idea! I\\'m very excited to see what these cars will do for society. They have advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, with any product this will always be true. Driverless cars have pros like GPS navigation and they provide more safety for the people, but cons such as weather conditions or technical errors.          ',\n",
       " \"As a consultant that helps other students with writing, I see many strange things from people with half finished essays. The one that grabs the trophy, however, was incredibly ridiculous. At the beggining of a students work, they talked about how Abraham Lincoln and George Washington had a conversation. Not only did it have nothing to do with their central theme of Lincoln being the best president, but I gaurentee you they did not have multiple people help review their work. We did get them the help they needed, and through multiple peoples advice, it was transformed into a pretty good persuasive essay. When searching for help, whether it's with editing a school paper, or understanding concepts that are confusing for you in a difficulty subject, it's always important to look for more than one opinion. If you were to only ask a singe individual, their response could be flawed for many, many reasons. When you consult multiple people, however, the room for error decreases significantly.\\n\\nFor example, if you needed to write an unbiased paper on the pros and cons of making abortion legal, asking more than one person would limit the scope of the bias. If you only asked one individual, their statements could be tainted if they had a preexisting opinion on the topic. However, if you were to consult multiple people, the scope of the bias would be severely limited. The more people, the less bias you risk, so asking only one individual could end up ruining a supposedly unbiased report. Not only is bias a problem to consider when asking individuals, making sure their statements are accurate can be equally if not more important.\\n\\nWhen asking people for advice, you must always consider whether what they're saying is actually true. Bias is incredibly important to weed out, but often fact checks can also help root out some bias too. Biased individuals are more likely to lie or include misleading statements in their advice. By discovering false or misleading statements, you can also discover hidden bias in the individual. None of us are always right, so people have mistaken opinions about many topics. When looking for help, you always run the risk of including false information from a well meaning individual, as you have nobody to fact check them against. You have no way to tell if what they're saying is true, and, if they deliver it more confidently, you may already be convinced it's a fact. Luckily, when you ask multiple people, and fact check all of their statements against one another, you can assure yourself a significantly smaller chance of obtaining false information. Although fact checking against other people can certainly help, there are other ways, including searching on Google or looking it up with a textbook, to fact check correctly. However, some statements are simply opinions and cannot be fact checked, only compared to other people's opinions.\\n\\nWhen attempting to rephrase a sentence that sounds strange or incorrect, or when trying to add more detail and glamour to an otherwise boring sentence, there is no right or wrong answer. Certain techniques may work better or worse, but there is never a fix all type solution. So when taking advice from someone who, for example, is helping you edit your paper, some things they say you cannot fact check with Google or a textbook. If you were to only consult this individual, they would have full control, and may make suggestions that aren't the best for your paper. That's why, especially when dealing with highly opinionated topics like rephrasing sentences and adding additional detail, its crucial to consult multiple people and make sure most agree with your changes to ensure they're the best for your paper. Oftentimes in a writing help after school club I'm a part of, we have to deal with problems like these where students need more detail, but there's really no right and wrong way to phrase the sentence. That's why we consult each other to make sure every change we make is for the good of that persons writing.\\n\\nWednesdays, after school, I work as a consultant to the writing center. In the club, younger students, usually from seventh grade, come to get help with their writing from older, more experienced students. Many times, seventh graders come in with half finished essays that could barely be considered rough drafts, but as it turns out they've already turned them in and need to re-write them for a higher grade. The process can be difficult, and sometimes grueling if the seventh grader doesn't want to and cooperate, but I still love consulting. Working there is a joy, but one of the things that really makes us able to go above and beyond to help other students is the ability to cross check with other consultants and work together. Often, seventh graders are assigned only one consultant to help them with their work. However, like I've said above, one persons opinion can definitely be flawed. This is why we employ many talented consultants, so if one doesn't know what to do or accidentally makes a mistake, others can catch it and further assist them.\\n\\nAsking multiple people for advice, no mater the topic, is always an important and crucial step of the writing process. By asking multiple people, you assure the least bias possible, the highest form of fact checking, the best way to phrase sentences and other similar opinionated subjects, and you ensure none of those you seek advice from made mistakes.\\xa0\",\n",

       " 'It is finally summer time, time for trips, picnics, and fun. School is finally over and it is time to rest, but the summer project is 60% of next years grade. The topic of the project is extremely boring. This is why students should be allowed to pick their own project topics. The project is hard enough without having a topic that is not interesting. Many teachers would say it would be easier for them to just assign a topic to each person, however, doing this could lead to students not doing it and starting off the year bad. Students should be allowed to have this choice because it may give them a sense of freedom, they are more likely\\xa0to do the project, and teachers dont have time to make up each topic for every student they have.\\n\\nInitially, students get to have freedom of their own. The majority of kids do not like being pushed to do something because it makes them feel helpless and small. For example, when a little kid does chores without being asked it makes them feel accomplished, but as soon as they are asked they refuse to do it. Same with this project, if students have a say in what they are doing they are more likely to do it. Another example is, school papers throughout the year. Over half of the prompts that the state gives are inadequate and boring. Frankly they are terrible prompts that you dont have enough to say to make a full paper, but if students are allowed to choose then they then they can find a prompt that they are actually interested in. In conclusion, many students would rather do a project that interest them and peeks their curiosity then have a boring topic.\\n\\nFurthermore, students need to be interested in the lesson and topic in order for them to do it. Everyone has been there where the teacher goes on and on about something that doesnt really matter. It seems like an hour has passed when it has been five minuets. In that moment the project doesnt get done. If students are given the opportunity to select the topic for the summer project people might actually have fun and enjoy their schooling. 75% of children say that they hate their schooling experience and 98% of those say its boring. As teachers try to make it not boring. For example,half of students do not do essay prompts because they do not like the topic. this is the same with summer projects. This could be fixed by letting the students choose a topic and how they want to complete it. In conclusion, many students need to like the project and want to do it for them to actually do it.\\n\\nLastly, teachers do not have\\xa0enough time to make up topics for each kid. There are many way to do this: a Google generator, one universal topic, taking the time to do it, selecting a few topics and using groups. Every person has at least seen one of theses ways done. Teachers are very busy people that have many things going on at once. For example some teachers have 100 students or more in their class, that is a lot of topics to make up. A Google generator would make the topics quick but most of the topics would be simple and not have much to build a project out of. Teachers have that many students to watch, to plan, to print, and to grade. A teacher who has to do all of that surly would not have the time to make these topics. One universal topic would work but then the teacher would be bored with 100 projects on the same topic. In conclusion, letting students pick their own topic is the most interesting and practical.\\n\\nIn conclusion, students should be able to pick their own topic because it will give them freedom, they would\\xa0be more willing to put in the work, and teachers would have more time for more important things. As teachers let the students pick out a topic of their choice that interests them. In the future more schools will allow their students have more choices regarding their education.   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   \\xa0   \\xa0',\n",

When you're taking classes online, you can learn at your own pace and in your own space, without feeling like you're being judged or compared to others. It's way more relaxed and comfortable, and you can focus on your own learning without feeling like you're in the spotlight. 💡\\n\\nAnd, let's be real, sometimes students cheat in class. 🙄 Like, I'm not gonna lie, I've totally looked at my phone during a test before, and I know other people have too. But with distance learning, you don't have to worry about that as much. You can take breaks whenever you need to, and you can even take the test in your pajamas if you want to! 😴 It's way more convenient and comfortable, and you can focus on actually learning the material instead of worrying about getting caught cheating. 🧐\\n\\nAnother thing I like about distance learning is that you can learn at your own pace. 📚 Sometimes, I learn faster than my classmates, and sometimes I learn slower. But with distance learning, I can take my time and really understand the material before moving on to the next thing. I don't have to feel like I'm falling behind or getting left behind, and I can take as much time as I need to master the material. It's way more flexible and personalized, and you can really focus on your own learning without feeling like you're in a race against time. 🏃\\u200d♀️\\n\\nFinally, distance learning is way more accessible. 🌐 Like, I know some kids who live in super rural areas, and they don't have access to good schools\",\n",
       " 'Summer projects, the cornerstone of any students journey through the seemingly endless maze that is education. Used as a tool to keep education flowing through the three month stretch of summer, summer projects are useful to many school districts. However, the issue with summer projects is not the work rather than who is going to design the work. Should teachers take time out of their busy day, or should students step up and design a summer project for themselves? Summer projects require care and effort as they are continuing the expansion of knowledge at times when learning is not popular. This is why teachers should design summer projects over the summer, rather than students.\\n\\nTeachers are the reason why education is even possible, they simply care more about education than an average student. A majority of students will take the opportunity of designing summer work and use it as a pass to create something that will not challenge their minds in order to enjoy time away from schooling. Teachers on the other hand will make the summer project challenging enough to keep knowledge flowing through summertime. Students do not always know what it takes to challenge the minds of thier peer, therefore if students were to make up the summer projects, the quality of the projects will go down. Teachers are more adept to challenging the mind of students.\\n\\nDesigning a summer project is not an easy task. In order to have an effective project, students will have to open their minds and think critically. Teachers already have plenty of experience making work that challenges the brain to think critically, as they have gone through many years of extensive training and education for this exact purpose. Knowledge and wisdom is what sets teachers and students apart, as teachers have more experience in making effective work for students.\\n\\nAn argument that could be used for students to make summer projects is that it would give students a chance to be creative with the work that they are giving themselves. For most students in this day and age, telling them to make their own summer work is like doing dishes after a Thanksgiving day feast. It is seen as tedious and will be met with little care and effort all while the person washing the dishes get to hear everyone else in the other room having a good time watching football. Students will not want to make their own work and will most likely give themselves easy work to get out of the assignment rather than thought provoking, challenging work.\\n\\nIf school systems are looking to enlighten students with knowledge over the summer, having teachers make the summer assignments would be the ideal situation. Teachers are simply more qualified to think of challenging work than students are.\\xa0',\n",
       " 'Cars have been a world wide trend for years, but is that trend coming to an end? A new one is coming into play, and it is the car-less suburb and city. The emissions from cars are putting a strain on the health of city air and officials around the world are setting forth the car-less street.\\n\\nIn Germany there is a little suburb called Vauban, which is almost completely car free. While ownership of a vehicle is allowed, the only place someone could park it would be a large garage at the edge of the community, which a space costs around $40,000 to buy. As a result 70 percent of the families ther don\\'t own cars. This new trend is predicted to cut down greenhouse gasses in suburbs and cities, for which cars are resposible. \"Automobiles are the linchpin of of suburbs.... And that, experts say, is a huge impedement to current efforts to drastically reduce gas emissions form tailpipes.... Passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of... gas emissions in Europe... and some 50 percent in... the United States.\"(In German Suburbs Life Goes on Without Cars by Elizabeth Rosenthal p. 5)\\n\\nIn the Colombian city of Bogota millions of city dwellers hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work on a special day called The Day Without Cars. The citizens agree it is a fruitful endeavor, that lowers pollution, releives stress, and provides a great opportunity to excersize. It even set a trend for two other cities who, for the first time since the event started three years ago, joined in the special day. \"These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,\" said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay. (Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky p.26)\\n\\nWhile cars still have their uses, it seems like they are slowly becoming a fading fad. People around the world are embracing a life without cars, and trying to put a dent in the world\\'s pollution. Who knows, if Americans embrace it, there might be an end to the obesity epidemic.

Not only does a change in the school lunch menu seem like a good idea, but it's also necessary for our overall health and well-being.\\n\\nIn my soccer team, I have practice every day after school. However, sometimes I feel tired and unmotivated to participate, often due to the lack of nutritious food in the school's lunch menu. My teammates have expressed similar sentiments, and many of them bring their own food to school because they are tired of eating the same unhealthy options every day.\\n\\nA change in the school's lunch menu could benefit not only my teammates and me, but all students. Eating healthy food can keep you energized and alert, which is especially important for students who are in school teams or studying for exams. It's also important to remember that our health is dependent on the food we eat, and as we grow, our bodies need food that helps them function at their best.\\n\\nI believe that a change in the school's lunch menu could be beneficial for all of us. A healthier body is stronger and more resilient, and it can help us perform better in all aspects of our lives. It's important to let the principal know about the benefits of this change, so that they can take action and make the necessary changes to improve our health and well-being.\",\n",
       " 'First of all, what is the Electoral College? The Electoral College is a process, not a place. This process consists of the selection of electors, the meeting of electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and counting of the electoral votes by Congress. It consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 is requited to elect the President.\\n\\nIn other words, under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors. And that`s what`s wrong with the Electoral Project system.\\n\\nFor example: If you live in Texas, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you`d not vote for this candidate, but for a slate of 34 Democratica electors pledged to John Kerry. But who are these electors? Who picks the electors in the first place? Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always\\n\\nThe electoral College is unfair and irrational. Voters don`t want to vote for a bunch of strange people. The voters in fact, wanto to vote for someone who they had chose. We son`t want to put our decision on someone else`s hand, we want to be in control of our own vote.    ',\n",
       " 'When the Constitution of the United States was written our founding fathers decided on an Electoral College as the way to ellect the president instead of a direct vote. The Electoral College is a process that makes a compromise between the popular vote of the citizens and the Congressional vote. When citizens vote for president they are actually voting for a member of the Electoral College that is going to select their president, rather than the citizens voting for the president themselves. The Electoral College is made of 538 electors, the number of electors from each state varies depending on the states Congressional delegation. Washington D.C. is counted as a state for this process and alloted only three electors. The electoral college should be kept in use because it simplifies the outcome and allocates more power to the larger states.\\n\\nThe Electoral College should continue being used in today\\'s government as a form of selecting the president because it simplifies the outcome of the vote. When voting with a popular vote system a debate over the outcome of the vote is very likely and will probably cause some constroversy. When the votes form the electoral college are counted the margin of victory is much higher which simplifies the result of the poll. During the election of 2012 Obama only recieved 51.3 percent of the vote, however he won the vote of the electoral college with an astounding 61.7 percent, a increase in the margin of victory by 10.4 percent. With this wide of a margin of victory a dispute over the victor of the presidential election is unlikely and\\xa0 almost impossible to argue against. Some might argue that the Electoral College is flawed because electors can choose not to vote for their canidate. It is true that this has happened in the past, \"in 1960, segregationist in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded on replacing the Democratc electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy.\" P.11. If this happened the popular vote for Kennedy would have gone to his adversaries instead. It is true that electors can choose not to vote for the canidate they pledged to and that this has happened in the past however the electors rarely betray their party\\'s nominee and a tie in the electoral vote is extreamly unelikely.\\n\\nAdditionally, the Electoral College sould be kept in today\\'s democracy because is allocates power to the larger states. It only makes sense that the larger states with a larger population should get more of a say in their government, and recieve more electoral votes than a small state with fewer people. With this system political infulence is restored to the larger states making the canidates focuss on the more populous areas. More power to the more populous states also means that run-off elections are avoided. In 1992 and in 1968 run-off elections were avoided due to the use of the Electoral College; \"Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College\" P.22. A run-off election extreamly complicates the election process however the chance of this happening is greatly reduced when using the Electoral College which almost always produces a clear winner.\\n\\nThe electoral college should be kept in use because it simplifies the outcome and allocates more power to the larger states. The Electoral College avoids the outcome of a run-off election. It also greatly reduces the chance of a dispute between the victor. Most people do not like the Electoral College because they are not directly voting for their canidate however many people fail to realize hat it is rare for an elector to betray his nominee. Electors rarely betray their canidate because they are chosen by the canidates party or the canidate themself. The Electoral College gives political weight to states and is very useful in deciding the new president with no debates over who won.    ',\n",
       " 'Ban on single-use plastics\\n\\nThe topic of the use of single-use plastic has become controversial in recent years. Many people are concerned about the negative impact these products have on the environment. Some people believe that single-use plastics should be banned to protect the environment, while others argue that this would not be the best solution.\\n\\nI believe that single-use plastics should be banned because of their harmful effect on the environment. Plastic is not biodegradable, and it takes hundreds of years for it to decompose, which means that plastic waste remains in our environment indefinitely. This plastic waste is harmful to the environment because it contaminates our land and water, killing animals and plants.\\n\\nMoreover, the production of plastic is an energy-intensive process that requires the consumption of large amounts of oil, natural gas, and other non-renewable resources. Therefore, banning single-use plastics will not only save the environment but also reduce the use of these nonrenewable resources.\\n\\nHowever, some argue that plastic is necessary for certain products and that banning single-use plastics is not a feasible solution. For example, plastic bags are commonly used because of their durability and affordability. It is argued that banning these bags would create problems for consumers who would have to carry their own bags or pay for more expensive alternatives.\\n\\nWhile it is true that banning single-use plastics may create challenges, I believe that we must prioritize the environment. We can promote the use of alternatives like cloth bags, which can be used multiple times and are environmentally friendly. We can also invest in new materials that are less harmful to the environment and promote recycling to reduce the amount of plastic waste that is not properly disposed of.\\n\\nIn summary, single-use plastics have a significant negative impact on the environment, which is a serious problem. Banning these plastics would be beneficial to the environment in reducing pollution and preserving our natural resources. While it may cause challenges, we must prioritize the environment and invest in alternative solutions that can help reduce our reliance on single-use plastics.',\n",

Some advantages of limiting usage are people are much happier and safier, you dont have to hear the aggravating sounds of motors and tires screeching by, and air pollution is decreased majorly.\\n\\nIn the first passage, Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two children stated, \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way\". By this she means she doesn\\'t have to worry about her or her families safety as much, being on the road is a lot more dangerous than walking. Driving you can never tell when there\\'s going to be an accident, everything just happens so fast. There is nothing you can do to prevent car wrecks from happening. You may do everyting in your power to be a safe driver but there will always be other people on the road not paying attention and cause a crash that you can\\'t prevent. Walking where you need to go is the safest way to get around. You don\\'t have to worry about car crashes or worrying over your families safety.\\n\\nAnother example of the advantages of limting car usage in passage one is, not hearing the screeching sound of car motors or tires flying by. Instead of hearing the familiar sounds of cars passing by you hear the joyful sound of children wandering around or riding their bicycles. People find it more calming to hear the sound of a child enjoying themselves instead of hearing the roaring and deafing sound of vehicles going by. When people are at home trying to relax they do not want to hear loud noises through their neighborhood. That\\'s suppose to be their winding down time to escape from everything. Without vehicles people would be a lot more calmer, and relaxed.\\n\\nThe last example came from the second passage. It states that there is a major decrease in air pollution in Paris as they enoforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\\xa0One day they ordered people with even-number license plates to leave their cars parked or suffer having to pay a fine. In the text it states that, \"Almost 4,000 drivers were fined and Twenty-seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.\" With this being done congestion was down sixty percent in the capitol of France. By them taking control they reduced the amount of air pollution in Paris.\\n\\nBy limiting the usage of vehicles we make people a lot happier and safeir, you don\\'t hear the annoying sounds of cars screeching by, and last but not least air pollution is decreased in a huge amount.       \\xa0    ',\n",

The first driverless care was created by Google in 2009. This car has traveled over a million miles to different places with no crashes. Even though the car is called \"driverless\" it techniqually is not. The driver would still have to take control of the car when traveling through traffic, passing an accident, or traveling through road work. Even though the driverless car has sensors, anitlock breaks, and driver assistance is it safe?\\n\\nMy position on the driverless car is undecided. I believe that this car has outstanding safety features but it also has some down falls. The outstanding features that this car has include getting the drivers attention if need and driving assistance found in the car. The car is to get the drivers attention if the road ahead requires human skills. For example the drivers seat can vibrate or flashing lights found on the windshield can aleart the driver that they need to take control of the car. The down falls of this car to me would be the ability to not be able to see something aorund the car. The driverless car has many sensors, which is good until they break. If one breaks and the driver does not know then the car could wreck and hurt others or the driver. Also another down fall is the cost of the car. If something breaks on the car the price of that part will be very expensive. I for see only people with higher incomes having these cars.\\n\\nIf I decided to be for the car I would like all of the safety features found on the car. I would feel safe while traveling in this car because of the features. The driverless car would be a good family car and would also help save money. By saving money this could allow a family to do other things with each other instead of using it on a car. I think the driverless car is a great idea for the new generation but I feel that the older generations will turn this car down due to unkown facts about the new car.\\n\\nIf I decided to be against the car I would have an unsafe feeling about the car. The dirverless car has many sensors and safety features but what happens when those break while driving. If they break while driving will the car wreck? Will it aleart the driver? How do you know when a sensor has gone out? All of these questions are left unanswered. This car could be a huge distraction to the driver and other people around that car. This could cause accidents, death, and severly injure people. I would rather be in a car where I am in control and I don\\'t have to worry about my car taking care of me.\\n\\nThe driverless cars created today have magnificent safety features but are they safe? The cars safety features include sensors, antilock breaks, and drivers assistance. The first car was made by Google in 2009 and has traveled many miles without a crash. I believe that there is good things about this car and bad things. A good thing about this car is all the new technological safety features put in this car to keep everyone in the car safe and everyone around the car safe. A bad thing about this car is what happens when the sensors break. Does the car tell you? Are you suposed to check before you get in the car? Do the sensors even break? There are many questions left unanswered to me and that makes me be against this car being allowed on the road. ',\n",
       " \"I think that students would really benefit from being able to attend classes from home. One reason is that it gives students a chance to work in a place where they are most comfortable. Some students work better in a quiet place, like their bedroom or living room, where they can concentrate without any distractions from other students. For example, my friend Sarah has a really hard time concentrating in class because of all the noise around her. If she could do classes from home, she could have a quiet space to work in and be much more productive. \\n\\nAnother reason that distance learning would be good is that students could save a lot of time by not having to travel to and from school every day. This would be especially helpful for students who live far away from their school or who have to take public transportation. For example, my cousin lives in a rural area and has to take a bus to get to school. It takes her two hours to get there and two hours to get back home. If she could do classes from home, she would save four hours of her day that she could use to do other things she needs to do.\\n\\nFinally, distance learning would be great for students who are sick or who have a disability that makes it hard for them to go to school every day. They wouldn't have to worry about missing classes or falling behind in their work. For example, my neighbor's son has a heart condition and can't go to school every day because he gets tired easily. If he could do classes from home, he could keep up with his work without having to worry about getting too tired.\\n\\nOverall, I think that distance learning would be a great option for students who want to be more comfortable, save time, or who have a disability or illness that makes it hard to go to school every day. It would give students more flexibility and help them be more successful in their studies.\",\n",

While it's important to take guidance from experts and authorities, it's equally important to trust your own instincts and make decisions that align with your values and beliefs. When you rely solely on others for decision-making, you may end up making choices that don't truly reflect your own desires and aspirations.\\n\\nFor instance, if you're choosing a high school major, your parents may have their own expectations and desires for you, but if you're not genuinely interested in the subject, you may struggle to succeed in it. Similarly, if you're in a relationship and your partner is making all the decisions, you may feel unheard and unvalued, leading to resentment and dissatisfaction.\\n\\nOn the other hand, ignoring your own instincts and taking wrong decisions can have serious consequences. When you don't listen to your own inner voice, you may end up in situations that are detrimental to your well-being. For example, choosing a career path that you're not passionate about can lead to burnout and dissatisfaction, while ignoring your own feelings and desires in a relationship can lead to feelings of resentment and unhappiness.\\n\\nConsulting family and other people before taking a decision can also be beneficial. They can offer valuable insights and perspectives that you may not have considered, and provide support and guidance during the decision-making process.

As stated in source 4\\n\\n:\\n\\nThe End of Car Culture by Rosenthal \" recent studies suggest that Americans as buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.\" So with that have been said we need to understand we drive no matter what but slow but surely we will stop driving in general.

       " \"Allowing students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing would be beneficial for students because it would allow them to not have additional school days at the end of the year due to weather and allow them to not fall behind on work due to an illness or family situation. By offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home, they'll be able to continue their learning while not having to worry about falling behind or having to attend school later into the summer.\\n\\nMany states in the United States get snow on a yearly basis, and as much as students love snow days, sometimes they can hinder a student's learning progress by preventing them from being able to travel to school safely. Many states have a law saying that if too many days of school are canceled due to inclement weather, school days will unfortunately have to be added onto the end of the school year, so students can complete their education for that year. This can cause problems for many students as they might have a summer vacation already planned that'll have to be adjusted due to the extended school year. For instance, there was one year where my county had to add school days onto the end of the year due to additional snow days and that had messed up a lot of student's plans for the summer. Personally, I was able to adjust my vacation plans; however, I had many friends who ended up having to miss the last week of school due to this. If schools offered distance learning on these snow days, where students can still attend class online with their teachers, they can prevent additional school days at the end of the year due to weather.\\n\\nDistance learning by way of online or video conferencing is also beneficial to students because it'll allow them to stay on track with school work and not fall behind due to an illness or family situation. There have been countless times where a student has been sick with a serious illness or had a family situation that prevented them from going to school for a week or so. Just missing one day of school causes a student to fall behind on a lot of work, so missing more than a week of school can definitely hinder a student's learning progress. I've had friends who were sick with an illness, like pneumonia, and were out of school for about two weeks; it took them weeks to be able to catch up and make up all of their missing work. Although a student should rest and recover when they're sick, being able to listen in on class could help them have less work in school significantly. Another example where distance learning is beneficial for students is when they have a family situation. A student might be out of school for a couple days due to a family situation and could fall behind on work. Being able to go to school online or video conference would help that student stay on track with work and not have to spend a week trying to catch up on missed work when they return to school. For example, I had a family member suddenly pass away a while ago, and I had to attend their funeral. As a result, I had to miss a couple of days of school and fell behind on a lot of work. Because it was so sudden, I couldn't plan ahead with my teachers and eventually was stressed out when I came back to school due to the amount of work I had. If online learning had been an option for me, I would've been able to stay on track in school and not have to deal with the stresses of catching up on missed work.\\n\\nI understand that online learning might not be beneficial for all students since each student has their own way of learning and that some students might not have the technology for it at home; however, distance learning would be able to get rid of additional school days due to weather and help a student stay on track when they need to miss school. Online learning could also be implemented easily due to the fact that everyone has a chrome book in school, so many schools could install an app on the chrome book that allows for online learning to be possible. Although many students would not like online learning, I think it would be a beneficial option to implement into the school systems in the long term.\\n\\nMany students struggle during the school year because of missing school days, whether it's due to weather or due to a family situation, and distance learning would be a great option for those students to be able to stay on track with the school curriculum while missing school. Offering online learning will help a student continue their education, prevent them from falling behind in school, and create less stress for them to catch up on missed work; therefore, I think online learning would be beneficial for students and that schools should implement it into their systems.\\xa0\",\n",

With the rise of the internet, online classes have become increasingly popular, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. While there are many benefits to online classes, there are also some drawbacks that need to be considered. In this essay, we will explore the benefits of online classes and compare them with traditional school methods. We will also analyze the advantages and disadvantages of both.\\n\\nBenefits of Online Classes\\n\\nOne of the main benefits of online classes is flexibility. Students can access course materials at any time, which means they can learn at their own pace. This is particularly beneficial for students who have busy schedules or who struggle with time management. Online classes also offer a greater level of convenience, as students can attend classes from the comfort of their own homes. This eliminates the need for commuting, which can save students time and money.\\n\\nAnother benefit of online classes is the ability to learn from anywhere in the world. With online classes, students can attend classes taught by experts from all over the world. This means that students can learn from a wide range of perspectives and gain a more diverse education. Online classes also offer a greater level of personalization, as students can choose from a wide range of courses that are tailored to their interests and needs.\\n\\nEffects of Online Classes on Students\\n\\nWhile online classes offer many benefits, there are also some potential drawbacks that need to be considered. One of the main concerns is that online classes can be isolating for students. Without the face-to-face interaction of a traditional classroom, students may feel disconnected from their peers and teachers. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression, which can negatively impact their mental health.\\n\\nAnother potential drawback of online classes is that they require a high level of self-discipline. Without the structure of a traditional classroom, students may struggle to stay on track with their studies. This can lead to procrastination and a lack of motivation, which can ultimately lead to poor academic performance.\\n\\nComparison with Traditional School Methods\\n\\nWhen compared to traditional school methods, online classes offer a number of advantages. Firstly, online classes offer greater flexibility and convenience, which can be particularly beneficial for students with busy schedules. Online classes also offer a greater level of\",\n",

I am lucky to be alive!\\n\\nWe don't work the whole time in the program, however. You would like what we get to do when we aren't working. We exlore and visit new, interesting places. We go to several different countries, and get to see how the people's culture, life style, and needs are different than ours. I had gotten a tour of a castle in Crete, visited China, Europe, and the Acropolis in Greece! Not only did we visit places, but we also had some freetime once in a while on board. We had baseball games, volleyball games, tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.\\n\\nIf you join the Seagoing Cowboys program, it is beneficial to 18 year old men, or men older than 18. Why? It is because when you are drafted to the military services at age 18, the military will count this program as your serving. I had turned 18 while I was on board and before we had even arrived to Greece, and I knew I couldn't be in the program and military at once. Lucky for me, the military coutned it as my service. Lastly, if you have ever wanted to meet other nations, you should join this program. Up to 44 nations join together to comeplete the tasks of the Seagoing Cowboys. Overall, I think that the Seagoing Cowboys are a very helpful, beneficial group of good people.\",\n",
       " \"Hey, so for this essay, I had to think about whether we accomplish more when we're always doing something or if inactivity also serves a purpose. Like, I know some people who are always on the go and always have a ton of stuff going on, but then there are others who are more laid back and don't do much. So, I was like, what's the deal?\\n\\nSo, I looked into it and found out that Thomas Jefferson, one of our founding fathers, had some pretty cool thoughts on the matter. He believed that inactivity can be just as important as activity, because sometimes taking a break and relaxing can be really helpful. Like, think about it, if you're always going, going, going, you can get burned out and stuff. But if you take some time to chill, you can come back to things with fresh eyes and be more productive. Makes sense, right?\\n\\nBut, on the other hand, inactivity can also have some pretty bad consequences. Like, if you're not doing anything, you're not learning new things or growing as a person. And that can be bad for your brain and your overall well-being. So, it's important to find a balance, you know?\\n\\nSo, how do we motivate ourselves to do more? Well, one thing I've found is that setting goals is super important. Like, if you have something specific you want to achieve, you'll be more motivated to work towards it. And it doesn't have to be something huge, it can be something small like reading a book or learning a new skill. Just having something to work towards can make you feel more accomplished.\\n\\nAnother thing that's important is choosing which activities to take on. Like, if you're always saying yes to everything, you can get overwhelmed and stuff. So, it's good to be picky and only take on things that are really important to you. That way, you can focus your energy on what matters most.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I think it's important to find a balance between activity and inactivity. Both are important in their own ways, and it's all about finding what works for you. So, don't be afraid to take a break and relax, but also don't be\",\n",
       " 'Inactivity has long been associated with negative outcomes, such as decreased productivity and poor health. However, recent research suggests that taking breaks and engaging in inactivity can actually have several advantages in fostering success. In this essay, I will analyze the benefits of taking breaks for understanding tests, long hours of work, mental rejuvenation, and physical health.\\n\\nFirstly, taking breaks can aid in understanding tests. Studies have shown that taking short breaks during exams can improve memory retention and reduce stress levels. This is because taking breaks allows the brain to rest and recharge, which can lead to increased focus and productivity when resuming the task. Moreover, taking breaks can help to break up the monotony of studying, making it more engaging and enjoyable.\\n\\nSecondly, taking breaks can be beneficial for long hours of work. Working for extended periods without taking breaks can lead to burnout and decreased productivity. Taking breaks can help to alleviate this by providing a much-needed break from the task at hand. This allows for mental rejuvenation and a fresh perspective on the task. Furthermore, taking breaks can help to prevent eye strain and reduce the risk of physical health problems such as headaches and back pain.\\n\\nThirdly, taking mental breaks can aid in finding creative solutions. Entrepreneurs often find that taking a break from their work can help them to come up with new and innovative ideas. This is because taking breaks allows the mind to wander and explore new possibilities. By stepping away from the task, entrepreneurs can gain a fresh perspective and come up with new solutions that they may not have considered before.\\n\\nLastly, taking breaks for physical and mental rejuvenation is essential for overall health and well-being. Taking breaks can help to reduce stress levels and improve mood. Moreover, taking breaks can help to prevent physical health problems such as eye strain, back pain, and headaches. Furthermore, taking breaks can help to improve cognitive function and memory retention, which can lead to increased productivity and success.\\n\\nIn conclusion, taking breaks and engaging in inactivity can have several advantages in fostering success. Taking breaks can aid in understanding tests, long hours of work, mental rejuvenation, and physical health. By taking breaks, individuals can improve their productivity, reduce stress levels, and find creative solutions to problems. Therefore, it is important to take breaks regularly and incorporate them',\n",

       " \"[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State ZIP]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator's Name]\\n[Address]\\n[City, State ZIP]\\n\\nDear Senator [Senator's Last Name],\\n\\nI hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my opinion regarding the current debate surrounding the Electoral College and its role in the election of the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained, and I would like to present several reasons to support my stance.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certain degree of certainty in the outcome of the presidential election. While disputes over the popular vote can and have occurred, such conflicts are less likely in the case of the Electoral College. This is due to the fact that the winner's share of the Electoral College votes typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. With the majority of states using a winner-takes-all system, the chances of a nationwide tie in the Electoral College votes are highly unlikely.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College promotes a sense of unity and representation for all regions of the country. By requiring a candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College prevents a situation where one particular region has enough electoral votes to single-handedly elect a president. This system ensures that a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be successful, as they would not be able to effectively represent the interests of the entire nation. It encourages candidates to campaign in a wide range of states, making them accountable to the concerns and needs of citizens across the country.\\n\\nIn addition, the Electoral College system emphasizes the significance of swing states. By focusing campaign efforts on these states, candidates are able to directly engage with voters who hold considerable influence in deciding the election. This leads to a more informed and thoughtful electorate, as citizens in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and critically evaluate the competing candidates. The ability of swing states to determine the outcome prevents the presidency from being determined by a few densely populated areas while disregarding the concerns of citizens in other parts of the country.\\n\\nMoreover, the Electoral College provides a fair balance between large and small states. The differential allocation of electoral votes based on population gives larger states a greater say in the election process. This ensures that candidates cannot solely focus on the needs of smaller, less populous states at the expense of larger ones. The Electoral College system recognizes that a state's size should be taken into account when considering its influence on the national level.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for runoff elections. Since the winning candidate must secure a majority of electoral votes, the system guarantees a clear winner. This avoids the complexity and potential division that would arise from additional rounds of voting if no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote.\\n\\nWhile critics argue that the Electoral College can disenfranchise voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, it is important to remember that individuals who vote in presidential elections typically do so to express their political preferences. The fact that not every vote swings a national election does not diminish the significance of individual citizens participating in the democratic process.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College serves as a vital component of our democratic system and should be maintained. It provides certainty in the outcome of the election, ensures representation and unity across regions, promotes informed voting through swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and eliminates the need for runoff elections. The Electoral College system may not be perfect, but it strikes a balance that preserves the integrity of our national elections.\\n\\nThank you for taking the time to consider my perspective on this matter. I trust that you will carefully evaluate the arguments presented and make decisions that best serve the interests of our nation and its citizens.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]\",\n",
       " \"I think we should totes transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy! First of all, fossil fuels are finite, which means they'll eventually run out and we'll be left with nothing. Renewable energy sources, on the other hand, are sustainable and won't run out. Like, ever!\\n\\nAnother reason is that fossil fuels are really bad for the environment. They release greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change and pollution. Have you seen the smoke coming out of those factory chimneys? It's like, totally toxic! Renewable energy sources, like solar and wind power, don't produce any emissions, so they're way better for the planet.\\n\\nPlus, renewable energy is getting cheaper and cheaper. Like, have you seen the cost of solar panels lately? They're super affordable now! And wind turbines are getting more efficient, so they can generate more electricity with less effort. It's like, a no-brainer!\\n\\nBut, some people might argue that renewable energy isn't reliable. Like, what happens when the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow? Well, that's where energy storage comes in. We can use batteries and other technologies to store excess energy generated by renewable sources, so we can use it when we need it. It's like, a backup plan!\\n\\nIn conclusion, transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy is the way to go. It's sustainable, better for the environment, and getting cheaper.

       " 'Venus, Earth\\'s \"twin\", has very harsh conditions. Unlike Earth, Venus is the hottest planet in our solor system. It has a very thick atmosphere, and the clouds are composed of highly corrosive sulferic acid. The aurthor of this article believes we should send mechanical mechines to explore this planet for all of its benefits, despite the dangers.\\n\\nMy first point, according to the article, is that Venus is the closest planet to the Earth in terms of density and size. Geographically, it has valleys, mountians, and craters. The author also suggests that long ago, Venus might have had oceans and that Venus could support life. This is why some researchers see value in the exloration. But, it provides the question: will exploring Venus be beneficial? The aurthor thinks that yes, this is a good opportunity.\\n\\nMy next point is that the author also states that we have already had missions there. If Earth poured money into going there at all, more than once, we must have seen some value in the mission because of its potential data and learning opportunities. The crafts may have only lated for days, but we still were able to learn. If we we not going to gain anything from the missons, we would not have wasted time and money to get there, multiple times.\\n\\nLastly, NASA has proposed a way to avoid the dangers. The facts about Venus are scary to some, but what if we could safely send a probe or spacecraft to Venus? According to the article, it would have to travel 30 miles above the landscape. Doing so would prevent the corrosion, it would have pleanty solor power, and the machine would not overheat as easily. \"Striving to meet the challange presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endevors.\"\\n\\nThis challange may help us, the Earth, learn more ablout habitable planets and how to care for our own planet.\\n\\nAs our technology grows, so does our possibility to go to Venus. It does not take a computer, it takes human curiosity. The aurthor of this article supports the possibility of going to Venus. Its informational possibilites, and its challanges are all positive things about the mission. The challanges are what pushes us, as humans further than we have gone before.

       " 'In recent years, online learning has become increasingly popular, especially in the K-12 sector. While online classes have their advantages, there are also some potential drawbacks to consider. In this essay, I will analyze the potential pros and cons of students taking online classes from home, especially in K-12.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of online classes is the flexibility they offer. Students can attend class from the comfort of their own home, which can be especially convenient for those with busy schedules or who live far from the school. This flexibility can also allow students to learn at their own pace, as they can watch lectures and complete assignments on their own schedule.\\n\\nAnother advantage of online classes is that they often offer a wider range of courses than traditional brick-and-mortar schools. This can be especially beneficial for students who are interested in pursuing a specific subject or career path that may not be available at their local school.\\n\\nHowever, there are also some potential drawbacks to online classes. One of the main concerns is that students may struggle with self-motivation and discipline. Without the structure of a traditional classroom, students may be more likely to procrastinate and fall behind on assignments.\\n\\nAnother potential drawback of online classes is that students may miss out on the socialization opportunities that come with attending school in person. This can be especially important for younger students who are still developing their social skills.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while online classes have their advantages, there are also some potential drawbacks to consider. Ultimately, the decision to take online classes from home should be based on a careful weighing of the pros and cons, and should be made in consultation with parents, teachers, and other relevant stakeholders.',\n",
       " \"The quote from the essay serves to illustrate the huge importance of examples and money in influencing others. For instance, in the essay the author cites the example of a group of people who decided to raise funds for charity. Despite their genuine cause and strong motivation, they had a hard time enticing people to donate to their cause. However, when they offered small rewards such as chocolates and movie tickets, individuals decided to contribute, proving that offers of money can indeed be an effective way to get people to act. Both using an example and offering money to the public allowed them to influence others and garner support for their cause. This example perfectly highlights the quote's notion that examples and money are the only influences on others.\",\n",
       " \"Students who struggle in school find it to be exhausting or even stressful, but participating in extracurricular activities may change their mind. Educating students may set them up for success in the future but can also put them at a worrisome situation to finish work on time and get projects done. Students who ask questions and seek for help may be overwhelmed and have trouble understanding the concept, in this situation students need to take their mind off this and do something to relieve them of their troubles. Extracurricular activities can impact students by relieving their stress, improving a more positive mindset, and finally having a chance to make new friends.\\n\\nSchool educates students about subjects that may be useful to have later in their lives, while this can be helpful it can also be stressful. Being in an extracurricular activity such as soccer club may gives students an opportunity to have fun and play with their friends, by doing this it can be enjoyable and take away stress from school. Although school is overwhelming sometimes, extracurricular activities make students embrace an opportunity that takes away all stress and helps them focus on exciting activities. By relieving stress the students will feel that they can achieve all the work given to them, this will boost their confidence knowing they can do anything.\\n\\nSometimes students might give up on their confidence because of all the work they have to get done. An extracurricular activity such as working on the yearbook can help students focus on an activity that helps them believe they are capable of achieving anything. Building confidence, having a better self esteem, and believing in yourself, are all important steps to having a more positive mindset, this impacts students because it helps students get their work done and doesn't have them worry about stressing out. A positive and confident mindset is one of the most important steps to achieve future goals, by being more confident anything can be accomplished.\\n\\nThe final reason why participating in an extracurricular activity is there will be plenty of people to work with and a chance to make some new friends. Beside all the fun and activities to do in different clubs there will also be people to work with and a chance to make some new friends. By making new friends it will improve one's mindset socially and is another way to deal with stress because when having new friends it can make someone feel happy and excited. Dealing with stress isn't an easy task, but a way to being happier is to make new friends.\\n\\nSchool can be stressful sometimes, but with extracurricular activities the amount of stress should be decreased. Extracurricular activities such as sports clubs, working on the year book, or even serving on student council are all opportunities for students to direct their focus on having fun instead of being overwhelmed by all the work. Being positive, relieving stress, and making new friends are all effective ways to not be overwhelmed in school, instead students should embrace going to school because of all the opportunities given.\\xa0\\xa0\",\n",

       " 'Single-use plastic products have become a controversial topic due to their negative impacts on the environment. Some people believe that single-use plastics should be banned to protect our planet, while others argue that they are necessary for convenience and affordability. In my opinion, single-use plastics should be banned because they are harmful to the environment and there are better alternatives available.\\n\\nFirstly, single-use plastics have a significant impact on the environment. Plastic bags, straws, and utensils are often used for only a few minutes before being thrown away, but they can take hundreds of years to decompose. This means that they end up in landfills, oceans, and other natural habitats, where they harm wildlife and pollute the environment. For example, sea turtles and other marine animals often mistake plastic bags for food and ingest them, which can lead to serious health problems or even death.\\n\\nSecondly, there are better alternatives to single-use plastics that are more environmentally friendly. Reusable bags, containers, and water bottles are all readily available and can be used multiple times, reducing waste and conserving resources. Additionally, biodegradable plastics made from plant-based materials are becoming more widely available and offer a more sustainable option for single-use items.\\n\\nFinally, banning single-use plastics would encourage people to be more conscious of their consumption habits and make more sustainable choices. It would also send a message to manufacturers that consumers are prioritizing environmentally friendly products and practices.\\n\\nIn conclusion, single-use plastics should be banned because they are harmful to the environment, there are better alternatives available, and it would encourage more sustainable consumption habits. While it may require some adjustments and sacrifices in the short term, the long-term benefits for our planet and future generations are worth it.',\n",
       " 'Many people believe that it is necessary to use a car to get from one place to another. Many studies have shown that this in fact is not true. There are many advantages to limiting car usage. I am in favor of limiting car usage because of the advantages it brings to the world. One reason to limit car usage is, because it reduces the amount of pollution. Another reason, is because many people around the world are in favor of limiting car usage. Lastly, limiting car usage lowers emissions and improves safety. Beneficial and critical, limiting car usage helps humans as well as the environment.\\n\\nFirst of all, limiting car usage reduces the amount of pollution worldwide. Reflective and didactic, Robert Fuller\\'s \"Paris bans driving due to smog,\" reflects the amount of pollution that is reduced due to limited car usage. For example, Robert Fuller explains that \"...[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.\" This statement layers Robert\\'s opinion that car usage can create vast amounts of pollution. If car usage is limited, the amount of particulate matter would decrease. For instance, this theory is created when Robert Fuller states \"The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.\"\\n\\nAnother reason, is because many people around the world are in favor. Appauled and enthusiastic, Andrew Selsky\\'s \"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\", molds the theory that limiting car usage has many advantages. For instance, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza states \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,\" as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. The fact that many people around the world are in favor of limiting car usage is shown, when Andrew Selsky sates that \"Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic.\" Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus is also in favor as he states \"The rain hasn\\'t stopped people from participating.\" These statements show that limiting car usage is very beneficial and has many advantages.\\n\\nLastly, limiting car usage lowers emissions and improves safety. This is shown in Elisabeth Rosenthal\\'s \"The End of Car Culture.\" Elisabeth states that \"...it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment.\" Elisabeth Rosenthal also states that \"...transportation is the second largest source of America\\'s emissions just behind power plants.\" Limiting car usage also improves safety. Last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, proposed partnering with telecommunications. Bill Ford wanted to partner with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which \"pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transpotation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.\" This statement forms the theory that limiting car usage has many advantages.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has many advantages. We as people of the world need to limit car usage for many reasons. The first reason is, because it reduces the amount of pollution. The second reason is that many people around the world are in favor of limiting car usage. The last reason is, because limiting car usage lowers emissions and improves safety. This is why we as citizens of the world need to limit car usage worldwide.    ',\n",

With out all of the loud sounds or engins working you can go for a soothing walk and clear your mind. Not only that you can do things with out worring about things like \"hmm am i gooing to get hit by a car today?\" have you ever worried about someone driving and gotten scaired because you have no idea how they are or if they made it home ok? If some one is walking you can be like ok little can go wrong from there to here so you wory less.\\n\\nCars are one of the leading causes of polution and smog in the world. In Paris the smog got so bad cars with even numbered plates could only drive certian days and viceversa\\xa0 with the odd numbered plates. Not only is it a good idea to stop because of of the green house gases but it is also good to stop becould it would stop trafic. 67% of all cars in france are desil so they were blamed for the smog over the gasoline. So in this case i say just go green for a while and ride bikes or hoof it to were you need to go.\\n\\nThe driving persentage in america is going down by its self so in america the progress is showing weather its on perpous or not. With the driving persentage going down there is less crashes of cours because of the less drivers. with the driving persentage going dow i is also leading to a better less damaging way of transportation suchas car pooling or public transportation there is also one of my more perfered ones biking it always works to get you from point A to point B and it is polution free unless you fart of course. sense i mentioned the point A to point B there are alturnative ways to get there like a bike a skate board a human powered scooter or the free one walking.\\n\\nIf we would adopt the life style of less travling by cars we would have closer thing to us like stors and traveling roots stors would be in walking distance but this means places like the suburbs are going to be more compact and alot less parking space. With adopting this life style we ar\\'nt agreeing on getting rid of all cars just to get rid of cars when they are irrelavent the cars would be parkes in a big parking garage on the edge of the town the cars would be used for long distance traveling.

       " \"Have you ever asked more than one person for help on what product to buy in a situation? Interviews are a perfect example of seeking more than one opinion. Interviews are seen on the news, in professional sports, and other places as well. There are a lot of people that can help you buy the right product as well. They can all open you up to new ideas. I think talking to more than one person on an opinion is a better choice because it shows you more than one option, it can change your perspective of a topic, and it informs you about what other people enjoy.\\n\\nFirst, I think it shows you more than one option. One opinion of a person might destroy your choice on an option rather than opening it up. The whole point of asking what is the better choice, is to make it better, not worse. You could already have the better opinion, and that person might ruin it, but more people would give you a good balance of what you need to know. Multiple opinions can stride you toward different answers. Different answers will most of the time make things go in the right direction. Its good to show variety in what you're going to pick in order to get the best choice. One opinion could be someone who isn't informed on the idea. They might not know anything about the topic and might just state a random answer. That can really throw you off if you don't get more ideas than just that one person. That can have the same effect as what I said before. That one person could mess it all up for you. All of the people you ask shows you more than what you thought was the best choice.\\n\\nNext, it can change your perspective on the topic. One person can change your option, but it may not lead you in the right direction. That direction could make you unhappy with your choice if you are comparing a product to see which one to get. You could take that one persons advice and follow it, but it might not be the best advice you could get. Multiple people have a better chance of leading you to the right opinion. When you get the opinion of multiple people, it balances out what might be the favorite option, or what might be the better option. A lot of times, changing your opinion is for the better. You could be looking at the wrong choice, and multiple opinions might lead you to the right path. It gives new ideas and ways to look at a situation and make the right choice. It can make you change your opinion.\\n\\nFinally, it informs you about what other people enjoy. Having more than one person's opinion might lead to an agreement with those people. You could be really stuck on a certain product you are trying to buy, and someone could save that entire situation by finding a good version of that product. You could also learn more about culture and peoples opinions in a certain area, or a certain time. Many people are different and sometimes that is based off of the environment around them, and where they grow up that could affect what a person likes. If you ask multiple people in the same area you grew up in, you should be leading yourself to the right choice. It can also lead to meeting new people, and making new friends. You could agree on an opinion and start a bond there. It all helps you on knowing not only what you like, but what a lot of other people like.\\n\\nIn conclusion, finding more than one persons view is better because it shows more than one opinion, it can change your own opinion, and it can inform you on what other people enjoy. If you are ever interviewing people, or looking for advice from other people to make the right decision, make sure you ask multiple people and\\xa0not just one person for that advice! I always ask friends, family, or other people for help and advice if I should do something or not. You've probably asked multiple people for advice as well!\",\n",

       " 'Though driverless cars may be a thing of the future, my vote is a no. Driverless cars are a bad idea no matter who is behind the wheel. Not only are the drivers put at risk but other people on the roads are put in grave danger when a human is not controlling the vehicle. Driverless cars may appeal to the younger generation because of the flahy technology but the lack of safety tips the scales towards the negative side.\\n\\nA driverless car\\'s name portrays the idea that humans do not need to be in control of the car that idea is incorrect. Drivers must stay allert and focused while in a driverless car. This is evident when the text states,\"They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.\" (7) This is concerning because people today tend to get distracted while driving a normal car. If the actual driving factor is taken away, drivers could get distracted by almost anything from technology to falling asleep. This would result in serious fatality to not only th person behind the wheel but to people around them.\\n\\nIn addition, the new entertainment systems in a car may be a new and alien experiance, they point to a rough road ahead. In an attempt to get the driver to pay attention while driving a driverless car, entertainment systems may be inserted in the car. This is pointed out when the text says,\"Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays.\" (8) Though these systems may keep the driver engaged, when it is time to take over the shift from watching or listening to a system to driving a car may take an extended period of time. The driver would also need to gain a sense of where he or she is while driving in order to take control. This would result in an increase in accident on the road.\\n\\nNo one is perfect and accidents do happen but in a driverless car who is to blame? This issue could cause serious law cases and court battles over injuries or damages indured in a crash with a driverless car. The article suggestd this when the text says,\"If the technology fails and someone is inhured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?\" (9) Not only does the confusion on who is to blame take immense time, it sucks thousands of dollars from the participants in a law suit. Though the court may rule otherwise, the accident could be a result of malfunctioning technology that can not be pinned to an individual.\\n\\nOn the other hand, driverless cars have multiple downsides, some aspects are clear improvements from automobiles today. The new sensor techology inserted into the driverless cars can improve braking and response to sudden stops. The author includes this in the arguement when they say,\"The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.\" (5) This would decrease the amount of damages done to cars from running into or backing over things because the sensors have eyes where the driver does not. The sensors can provide an advantage to safe driving that would not come from any ordinary car.\\n\\nAll in all, driverless cars are unsafe and an illogical invention. The lack of attention that is needed when not driving a car will result in mass accidents and injuries when a driver is needed. Entertainment systems in cars only add to the danger in driverless cars and are unnecessary. Crashes and accidents can not be settled or avenged in court because there is no clear cause to the incident. Though the sensor technology incorporated in the driverless cars gives an advantage for braking and controling the vehicle, the bad outweighs the good in this situation. Driverless cars may be a thing of the future but as of right now, humans are not ready to hit the road without a person behind the wheel.',\n",
       " 'I personally do not agree with the usage of a cellular device while operating a motor vehicle. Although some believe that a cellular device is perfectly fine to use while driving, They are far from right. It has resulted in many fatalities all across the nation and is illegal in some states. Using a cellular device while driving is not only a risk for your own well being, but those around you as well.\\n\\nIf you\\'re ever at a stop light and you look around, most likely somebody is on their phone. While driving you should have complete focus on the road at all times. A cellular device takes all of your focus off the road, now making you a distracted and therefore, a dangerous driver.\\n\\nMy Uncle used to operate his phone while driving, in result, one morning on his way to work, he was in a car accident. Thankfully nobody was hurt and the damage to his vehicle was reparable. You may think, that will never happen to me, well an accident can happen to anybody, any time, and anywhere. He could have seriously hurt himself or another person. Distracted driving is not a joke, and it should be taken seriously. When you get behind the wheel you are automatically putting your life along with the others in the car and on the road with you at risk. Do you want to be responsible for taking another person\\'s life, another human being like your or me?\\n\\nLet\\'s say you have an accident while sending a text. The other person may have been hurt or perhaps killed. You are at fault. If the accident resulted in death, you\\'re going to face jail time because that\\'s considered manslaughter. If you just hit them, you\\'re paying for their vehicle and medical bill, not to mention your insurance rate is going to skyrocket. Is all of that worth sending a quick text? Risking the lives of the men, women, and children around you and in your community?\\n\\nAllowing yourself to be a distracted driver not only shows your disregard for others but also shows the lack of self control you posses with technology. I believe cell phones have become an addiction. Many people can\\'t live without them and are constantly on them. Cell phones have become more and more convenient and connected to the world. It can sometimes be hard to accept the fact that it is not a necessity to have on at all times. There are plenty of excuses that people often use. But there is bluetooth in many newer model cars, and bluetooth headsets, which is still no excuse.\\n\\nSome excuses may be, my mom is sick, I was checking on a family member, I was calling into work, etc... Many people take advantage of those so called,\"excuses\". If you need to use the phone that badly, pull over and make the call. Don\\'t risk the lives of others to call your best friend and tell her about your day. Being a distracted driver isn\\'t okay and it isn\\'t cool. Using a cell phone while driving is illegal in the state of Georgia, yet people do it anyways. Nothing is more important than your own life, or others. So as a result, I do believe that using a cellular device while operating a motor vehicle should be prohibited by law.   ',\n",
       " 'Prompt: The issue of gun control is a highly contentious one in many countries. Argue for or against stricter gun control laws, providing specific reasons and examples to support your position.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nGun control is a controversial topic in many nations. The issue of firearms regulation has been the center of political debates, social media platforms, and rallies. The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution permits citizens to carry arms, but the government has the right to impose regulations on gun ownership. Therefore, I strongly advocate for stricter gun control laws since they would reduce gun violence and make society more secure.\\n\\nFirst of all, stricter gun control laws will significantly reduce the number of homicides committed every year. In countries where there are strict gun laws, such as Japan, the United Kingdom, and Australia, there is a lower crime rate related to firearms than in countries where gun control laws are less strict, like the United States. For example, the gun-related homicide rate is more than five times higher in the United States compared to the United Kingdom, which has strict gun laws. This is a substantial difference and shows the impact that strict gun laws could have in decreasing the death tolls caused by firearms every year.\\n\\nFurthermore, stricter gun laws would limit the availability of arms to criminals, terrorists, and mentally unstable individuals who may pose a threat, thus making it difficult for them to access or purchase firearms. It would, therefore, make society safer and more secure. According to the FBI, over 1.1 million background checks for potential gun buyers were rejected in the United States between 1998 and 2014 because they could have been felons, domestic abusers, or had been declared mentally ill. If these individuals had been able to pass background checks and purchase firearms, they could have been involved in gun-related violence, causing more harm to innocent people.\\n\\nLastly, gun control laws would reduce accidental shootings and firearm suicides. In cases where individuals are allowed to purchase firearms without a waiting period, they may act impulsively, leading to more accidents that can result in death. In the United States, more than 20,000 firearm suicides were recorded in 2019 alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Stricter laws would require a mandatory waiting period for potential gun buyers, thus giving them more time to think things through and reducing the likelihood of impulsive behavior.\\n\\nIn conclusion',\n",
       " \" Is it beneficial for young students to commit to a career path in high school? It is a wise decision that allows students to focus on their desired career, rather than on subjects that do not align with their goals. There are several reasons why I believe this is a good idea.\\n\\nFirst, students can follow in the footsteps of their parents or other family members who have chosen successful careers. This can be a valuable source of guidance and inspiration, as well as a way to connect with their family's legacy. By following in the footsteps of their parents or other family members, students can gain insight into the skills and knowledge required for their chosen career, as well as the potential challenges and rewards.\\n\\nSecond, students can use their high school courses to excel in their chosen career path. High schools offer a variety of courses that can help students develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in their chosen field. For example, a student who wants to become a chef can take cooking classes, while a student who wants to become an engineer can take courses in math, science, history, and English. By taking these courses, students can gain a head start on their future careers and be better prepared for the challenges that lie ahead.\\n\\nFinally, committing to a career path in high school can help students stay focused and motivated. When students know what they want to do, they can plan their courses and activities around their goals. This can help them stay on track and avoid distractions that might lead them away from their desired career path. Additionally, when asked about their future plans, students who have committed to a career path can speak confidently and with conviction, which can be a valuable asset in both personal and professional settings.\\n\\nIn conclusion, committing to a career path in high school can be a beneficial decision for young students. By following in the footsteps of their parents or other family members, using their high school courses to excel in their chosen field, and staying focused and motivated, students can set themselves up for success in their future careers.\",\n",

While there are many factors that can influence a student's decision-making process, it is crucial for high school students to consider their future and make a commitment to a career path. In this essay, we will explore the reasons why committing to a career at a young age is important and how it can benefit students in their future endeavors.\\n\\nFirstly, committing to a career at a young age can help students prepare for their future as adults. As adults, each person has a responsibility to contribute to society and make a positive impact. By committing to a career at a young age, students can begin to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in their chosen field. For example, if a student is interested in pursuing a career in healthcare, they can start by taking courses in biology, chemistry, and other related subjects. This will give them a solid foundation to build upon as they progress through their education and career.\\n\\nSecondly, committing to a career at a young age can help students stay focused on their goals. When students have a clear idea of what they want to achieve, they are more likely to work hard and stay motivated. By selecting a career path at a young age, students can begin to set achievable goals and work towards them. For instance, if a student is interested in pursuing a career in engineering, they can start by taking advanced math and science courses in high school. This will give them the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in their chosen field.\\n\\nLastly, committing to a career at a young age can give students the time to explore their options and find the career that is right for them. Each person has different strengths, interests, and talents, and it is important to find a career that aligns with these. By committing to a career at a young age, students can take the time to explore their options and make an informed decision. For example, if a student is interested in pursuing a career in the arts, they can take courses in music, theater, or visual arts to determine which field they are most passionate about.\\n\\nIn conclusion, committing to a career at a young age is an important decision that can have a significant impact on a person's future.

Homeschooling is when the parent of a child, or sometimes even the child themselves, chooses for the child to be taught school materials right from the comfort of their homes. Another alternative is for a school to have video conferencing set up so that the student can be taught by a teacher from a school right at home. This style of learning could either be very beneficial or detrimental for the student in many ways. I believe that students could very much benefit from being able to attend classes from home online or through video conferencing because it's convenient, could allow for more direct learning from an individual teacher, and could even reduce stress for parents.\\n\\nBeing able to attend a class online from is very convenient because it could give the student more time to work and study the different subjects they'd have to take, while allowing them to have a level of comfort regular school just can't give to them. They wouldn't have to worry about being late for school, or having to walk if their parents weren't able to drive them if they lived far from their school. Overall, giving students the ability to take classes at home could play a crucial part in stress-free education.\\n\\nStudents could also benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it allows them to be taught directly from a teacher. There wouldn't be any disruptive classmates that distracted them, they'd be receiving the teacher's full attention. Allowing this would greatly improve the average student's overall academic performance, and would allow for many more creative and intelligent minds.\\n\\nAllowing students to attend online classes would reduce stress on the parents as well. They would no longer have to worry about having to rush their child out of the house if they slept in too late, or was simply being too slow. Online schooling would simply allow the student to take more time with their classes, which would prevent parents from being stressed out about students.\\n\\nOn the other hand, some may say that allowing students to take online classes could have a negative effect on the student's social skills. While this could be true in some instances, I don't believe that school is the only place a student could be social in. There a plenty of other things that could play a key role in boosting a student's social performance.\\n\\nIn conclusion, giving students the ability to take online classes or have video conferencing is very beneficial, and has more positive effects than negative.

To prevent his from occurring, schools have began to assign summer work to students. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure that they continue learning during their break. However, students often times\\xa0find these teacher-designed and regulated projects boring and tedious. These summer projects should be student-designed to increase student interest and motivation while they work on this mandatory project, and to teach students how to be independent researchers, allowing them to continue learning during their break and providing them with the ability to pursue the topic if desired.\\n\\nIf a student had the ability to design their own summer projects, it would not only increase the student's rate of productivity, it would also increase the quality of the results. In addition, a student's desire in researching their topic will allow them to retain this knowledge and continue learning during their break. Students often groan at the idea of completing a mandatory project, whether\\xa0it is in-school or out of school. Furthermore, teacher-designed topics fail to provide students with the ability to research a topic that they are interested in. This depletes a student's desire to complete the assigned summer project. Students would find summer projects more enjoyable if they had the ability to design their project and chose their topic. This would, in turn, increase the students' motivation and desire to conduct the project. Furthermore, the more time and energy that a student puts into their project, the better the overall quality of the project and of the results. This would occur if a student had the desire to do the project, which stems from the student's interest in the project. For example, many students across the United States complete an in-school science-project. This can be compared to a summer project because it has a similar process. First, students are either assigned a science topic by a teacher or they are told to chose a topic based on given criteria. Based on first-hand experience and student feedback, students enjoy conducting and completing the project if they had a choice of picking the prompt. This is because the students are able to choose a topic that interests them instead of being forced to research a topic that they are uninterested in. In turn, the quality of the science projects also improves in student picked topics due to the fact that students have a desire to spend more time on them.\\n\\nAllowing students to design their own projects teaches them how to be independent researchers and promotes creativity by forcing students to plan procedures for a project. When teachers design projects for students, they include everything: topic, materials, time line, and procedure. The student rarely has to conduct any planning before completing the project. This takes away the research and the independence aspect of a project. The teachers babies the students through the process and fails to teach them how to decide the procedure, time line, and materials on their own. If a student isn't given the chance to plan out their own project, they will never learn how to. Planning also promotes and excersizes students' creativity. They are able to find new, creative procedures to tackle a project. As stated previously, students have more desire in researching topics that they are interested in. Student-designed projects would promote advanced and in-depth research among students. As a result students exercise independent research skills, which provides students the with the skills to continue research and promotes continuous learning.\\n\\nFew may argue that students cannot be trusted in designing a project that is relevant to the curriculum and that allows for students to learn at the same time. Furthermore, students may be inclined to design a project that is too simple for them. This may easily be countered by the teacher. Just because students would be able to design their projects, doesn't mean that the teacher doesn't oversee their actions. Traditionally, when students are given an in-class assignment to design their own projects, their ideas must be approved by a teacher. The teacher also provides the students with guidelines to center their project topic around. This process would be the same for a summer assignment. Before school lets out, students would show the teacher their project plan and confirm that it follows the guidelines while being challenging enough for students. This allows for the students to enjoy their project and learn at the same time. Few may also argue that allowing the students to design their summer projects would result in mad time management since students would also control when certain tasks may need to be completed. Teachers also have the ability to counter this by providing a calender for when certain parts of the project need to be turned in. One teacher would assign a summer project with the same guidelines for a whole class, which allows for the projects to have fairly similar requirements. This makes it easy for a teacher to create certain turn-in dates throughout the summer. Implementing turn-in dates would decrease the students' ability to procrastinate and forces them to manage their time wisely.\\n\\nSummer-projects are an excellent way for students to continue to learn over break while enjoying themselves. They are also a variation in school work as they provide more freedom and flexibility than in-class work. Consequentially, summer projects should be student-designed to increase student interest and motivation in the project, which allows them to care about the quality of research and work that they conduct.\\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\",\n",
       " \"People say working in groups is better than working alone, but thats their opinion even though it helps others more than it helps other individual's. I still know working alone is better because all my life i've been working alone since sixth grade. I wasnt really the person to just jump in and meet others or ask for help when i needed them.\\n\\nEvery person has to go through many difficult times looking for a group but, Their just too shy or too nervous to say a word to other people, I would know because i was in the same problem. It can be hard but, the reward is so worth it.\\n\\nPeople say working alone has no distractions, finishing faster than others, or learning things on our own. Other individual's say that having no distractions can help them work without stopping but, sometimes there are many difficult situations where we cant do much to work while being distracted, maybe being in quiet place may help. Finishing our work can easily be done without a group, like in our jobs, an office, or even at school. Not everyone has a group to be in except for people that know each other , They have many people that wish to be in a group like them. Back then when i was a little boy, I didnt know English so it was harder for me to understand teachers, or even students till i met two other kids that spoke the same language as me. I was happy to actually find two people that speak the same language as me but, that didnt last long because i never got to see them again. Till then i worked alone, avoiding others, sticking close to myself, even studying alone without anybody. My mother or father couldnt help me as much. That made things worse for me. Thats how i learned to do things all on my own without help. In a quiet place, We'er able to finish other assighment's from our jobs or school work. Teachers and students love to be in a quiet place because it helps them concentrate more than being in a group.\\n\\nIn conclusion working alone is better than working in groups. next time try working on alone, in a quiet room.\",\n",
       " \"Dear principal,\\n\\nI believe that the cell phone policy should be that we can use cell phones during free-time. Most students use cell phones right now and there not suppose to, so imagine that you say\\n\\n-No cell phones are allowed at school no matter what. Kids will bring there cell phones anyway and ignore the rules, and they don't care if they get into trouble or not.\\n\\n-Yes, you can bring cell phones but only for the free-time given during school, and during classes the phones must be turned off. The students will listen a little bit better although some may use there phone's for free-time then just keep there phone on during classes, but that's better than sneaking a phone around school when your not even allowed phones in school.\\n\\nEven if we were allowed to use our phones during free time I think that we should only be able to text, but I don't think that we should be able to call people. Because if there is an emergency of some kind than you shouldn't be on the phone, and if a teacher or someone is trying to talk to you, you shouldn't be on the phone.      \",\n",
       " \" It's often said that having a positive attitude is the key to success in life. But what does it mean to have a positive attitude, and how can we demonstrate it in our daily lives? Here are three examples of how to cultivate a positive mindset and how it has helped me achieve success in my own life.\\n\\nIn my first year of college, I was a shy and introverted person. I didn't talk to anyone, and I felt like I didn't fit in with my peers. I remember that I had a particularly difficult teacher, whose name was Ms. Johnson. I struggled to keep up with her assignments, and I often felt frustrated and discouraged. But what if I had approached the situation with a positive attitude? What if I had sought out help from my teacher and classmates, instead of feeling like I had to figure everything out on my own? What if I had embraced the challenges that Ms. Johnson presented, instead of feeling overwhelmed by them?\\n\\nIn my second year of college, I made a conscious effort to be more positive and outgoing. I joined a club, volunteered for a local charity, and started talking to more people on campus. As a result, I made new friends and gained the respect of my professors. When a professor took the time to help me with a particularly difficult assignment, I felt grateful and motivated to do my best. When I received an A on an exam that I had been struggling with, I felt proud of myself and my progress.\\n\\nIn my third year of college, I faced some unexpected challenges. I lost my laptop, which was my only means of completing assignments, and I missed a class because of a family emergency. But instead of feeling defeated, I turned to my friends and professors for help. They lent me a laptop, gave me extra credit on assignments, and offered to help me catch up on missed material. I felt supported and encouraged, and I was able to overcome the obstacles that I faced.\\n\\nIn conclusion, having a positive attitude is essential to achieving success in life. By embracing challenges, seeking out help, and being grateful for the support of others, we can cultivate a mindset that helps us thrive in all areas of our lives.\",\n",
       " \"Online school can be beneficial in many ways, but is it worth it? Many students take online school, but aren't getting the important skills they need in life such as communicating and collaborating, others believe that online school is beneficial because of how flexible it is and the amount of work the student is required to do.\\n\\nGoing to school can give you more practice on life skills such as communicating. In school kids are prepared with communication skills such as working with other students on a project or communicating with their teachers about a missed assignment or a missed test. Communication is used everyday in life. While in school from K-12, students are taught to communicate what they want and what they need. Students are taught to communicate if they need help, because if they don't it is a downward spiral to their learning. Communicating is very important in working with others and in the work foce, without that important skill, life becomes very difficult.\\n\\nGoing to school also provides the skill of collaborating. Many kids who go to school receive more practice through school work and presentations. Whether it is just working with someone on class work or even working on a presentation. Many teachers will assign classwork, or projects that give the student the option to work with another person or alone, but sometimes the teacher won't give the option to work alone and make it mandatory that you work with another classmate. Working with another student gives the students the opportunity to both take their ideas and put them together to complete the task at hand. Collaborating in school gives the student the practice they need when they enter the real world. Collaborating is very important in life and is used everyday, especially in the workforce.\\n\\nOthers believe that online school is best for a student, because of the flexibility it gives the student and the amount of work the student is given. Taking online school gives the student the freedom to work on their own schedule throughout the day and turn in work when they want by the time the work is due. Online students are also give the opportunity to have more breaks, where as going to school the only break the student gets is lunch time. Online students have the flexibility to wake up later and work to their speed. While students in school have a set time to arrive at school, what time to go to certain classes, and how fast they gotta work. The workload compared from online school and in school are very different. In school if a student has an assignment done, the next thing they know, they have another one for them to do. On top of that students usually go home with homework after that. While online schools work load is far less. Once the student completes their lesson for that class they are done for the day.\\n\\nIn conclusion, online school has many benefits such as flexibility and work load. While going to school has a far greater benefit, with preparing the student for the real world with life skills such as communication and collaboration. Many students take online school, but they aren't getting the important skills they need in life such as communicating and collaborating, others believe online school is very beneficial because of how flexible it is and the work load being much lower than going to school.\\xa0\",\n",
       " 'School lunches have been a topic of debate for many years. Some people argue that school lunches should be healthier, while others believe that they should be left alone. In this essay, I will explore the pros and cons of changing school lunch to a healthier option, and consider the effects of the change on students with different religions, races, and body types. I will also identify possible solutions to ensuring that all students are able to eat healthily in the cafeteria, including the possibility of offering food from around the world.\\n\\nOne of the main arguments in favor of changing school lunch to a healthier option is that it would improve the overall health of students. Currently, many school lunches are high in calories, sugar, and salt. This can lead to a variety of health problems, such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. By offering healthier options, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, students would be more likely to make healthy choices and maintain a healthy weight.\\n\\nHowever, there are also some potential downsides to changing school lunch to a healthier option. For example, some students may not like the taste of the new foods, or they may not have the financial means to purchase them. Additionally, some students may have religious or cultural beliefs that conflict with the new menu options. For example, some students may not eat meat, or they may follow a specific diet for religious reasons.\\n\\nTo address these concerns, it may be necessary to offer a variety of healthy options that accommodate different dietary needs and preferences. For example, schools could offer vegetarian or vegan options, as well as options for students with gluten intolerance or other dietary restrictions. Additionally, schools could offer food from around the world, which would provide students with a wider range of healthy options to choose from.\\n\\nIn conclusion, changing school lunch to a healthier option has both pros and cons. While it would improve the overall health of students, it could also pose challenges for students with different dietary needs and preferences. To ensure that all students are able to eat healthily in the cafeteria, schools should offer a variety of healthy options that accommodate different dietary needs and preferences. Additionally, schools could offer food from around the world, which would provide students with a wider range of healthy options to choose from.',\n",

But if while going to those places you relized you where just killing the earth every mile at a time.

The soulution isnt as simple as everyone in the world giving up there car, But what if there is a long term soultion to fix this big problem.\\n\\nIn Vauban, Germany residents of this\\n\\nUpper class community have given up cars in a experimental test to see the results of giving up cars to see others ways people could do about getting place to place and helping stop green house gases along the way. The results of doing this could mean that other countries, towns and cities may want to try this as well. In the town people make there way around by transportation such as bikes, running and walking. With this in mine you may be thinking what is I want to go the mall and its down a highway?

On a Monday all cars where to not be on roads and stayed parked. With the option to leave your car at home or pay a fine of 22 euro's, 4000 drivers were fined and 27 got there car towed away. With smog polluting the air tempertures and weather changes begin to happen with cold night and warm days car emissons where\\xa0 trapped by warmer air. The act was a success and most pollution in the city was gone so by tuesday everyone could return back to driving.\\n\\nIn Bogota, Columbia Only buses and traxis where permitted fir the Day with a population of 7 million, the whole thing was a huge success and there was a huge turnout. The purpose of this was athe goal to promote alternative transpotation and reduce smog. Millions of colombians biked, skated hiked and took buses during the car free day leaving traffic jams and easing stress to many people. Authorties came to Bogota to see the event and not only where they enthusiastic but with them liking how the even happened it means they could do it for there city making a chain recation to more and more till all people would like to participate in this oppurtunity to help save the earth. This event was not a tragicic loss of not being able to drive it was just showing that there are other means of transportation and not driving your car can help you in many ways.\\n\\nSo with these efforts of showing it dosent hurt to try something and it can be a train reaction to starting something big to end green houses gases that people all over give to the earth on a daily baisis. This just shows that cities like ours could try things like this and maybe help start something that can have sucha huge impact on our lives. With this maybe peopl ewill start to relize tha tcars arent all a big thing, and maybe the peak could come to a end and people could start somehting new.

This can help our states because in the whole world 50 percent of polution comes from the United States. This can be a problem because if we want to see changei n out world we need to start off small to get to the end of green house gases.       \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0    \",\n",
       " \"Sometimes in life, advice may be needed in any type of situation. Yes advice could be told by one person, but I believe it is better if a person is given advice from multiple people. I feel this way, because using different people's advice, in the same situation at the same exact time, could work better than listening to one person. Also seeing different perspectives from different people can make a person see a situation differently and how they might want to solve it.\\n\\nFirst, Using multiple people's advice in unison can work better than just taking one person's advice. Look at different types of sports players. They learn different techniques from a line of coaches, teammates, and trainers to then use everything they've learned from all of these people at the same time. They know more than the average person and this makes them better in that sport. Take Stephen Curry for example, being one of the best guards in the league, he has had to get advice from all of his coaches, trainers etc. Now he uses everything that he has learned to become one of the best point guards in NBA history.\\n\\nSecondly, seeing different perspectives or opinions from different people can make a person see a situation differently. Seeing how two people may think differently can make the person who is taking the advice see things differently and have another route to go with in their decision. In movies that have ghosts of Christmas spirits, the ghost takes the main characters to see themselves, but from a different view. This makes the main character change their ways. This is how seeing perspectives change the way people think.\\n\\nIn conclusion, advice from multiple people at a time helps a lot, because using different people's advice at the same time can make a person better at whatever they are doing. And also because seeing more than one perspective from multiple people can make whomever think differently about how they may want to solve their problem.   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\",\n",

       " ' The idea of extending school days to four days a week has been a topic of debate among educators, parents, and students. While some people believe that this change would benefit students, others argue that it could have negative consequences. In this essay, I will explore both sides of the argument and provide my own perspective on the matter.\\n\\nOn the one hand, proponents of a four-day school week argue that it would provide students with more time to learn and engage in extracurricular activities. By having more time in the classroom, students would be able to focus on their studies and take advantage of additional resources and support. Additionally, a four-day school week could help reduce stress and burnout among students, allowing them to better balance their academic and personal lives.\\n\\nOn the other hand, opponents of a four-day school week argue that it could have negative consequences for students and their families. For example, students who have part-time jobs or are responsible for taking care of younger siblings may not have the time or resources to continue working or caring for others. Additionally, students who are already struggling academically may struggle even more with the added time in the classroom.\\n\\nIn my opinion, the benefits of a four-day school week may outweigh the potential drawbacks. While it is true that some students may struggle with the added time in the classroom, this could be mitigated through additional support and resources provided by schools. Additionally, the potential benefits of reduced stress and burnout among students could have a positive impact on their academic performance and overall well-being.\\n\\nUltimately, the decision to implement a four-day school week should be based on a careful consideration of the potential benefits and drawbacks. While it may not be the best solution for all students, it could be a valuable tool for improving the academic and personal lives of many.',\n",
       " 'The debate over whether or not smartphones are a positive or negative addition in the classroom has been going on for some time. There are arguments to be made for both sides, each with their own arguments for and against their usage in school. On one hand, cell phones offer students many advantages, such as the ability to access a vast amount of information quickly and efficiently. Additionally, using a smartphone gives students more flexibility when it comes to accessing their course materials and can also allow for increased collaboration among students. On the other hand, there are negatives associated with using a cell phone in the classroom, including distractions, increased potential for cheating or sharing answers, and a lack of focus on the lesson. \\n\\nWhen compared to using computers in the classroom, cell phone use offers a different set of advantages and disadvantages. For instance, using a smartphone may offer the same ability to access a large amount of information quickly and efficiently but there may be fewer distractions. Additionally, smartphones are much more affordable and accessible than computers. Unfortunately, smartphones also often have more limitations than computers on what kind of tasks can be done. \\n\\nThe effects of using phones in the classroom can be wide-ranging and depend largely on how phones are used. If students are using their phones during class time for learning purposes, it can be beneficial. However, if they are using it for social purposes, such as texting or checking social media, this can lead to a decrease in focus and engagement. It can also lead to an increase in cheating or sharing information during tests or exams. \\n\\nUltimately, while smartphones can have both positive and negative effects in the classroom, there are steps that can be taken to manage their use. Schools can implement policies that limit the types of activities that students can do on their phones, such as prohibiting social media use, or restrict their use to certain times during the day. Additionally, schools can educate students on responsible phone use and provide resources for academic support. These steps can help ensure that students are using their phones in a responsible way that will still allow them access to the resources they need to succeed.',\n",
       " \"The Electoral College vote draws many emotions. It has many supporters and many enemies. There was a huge debate over the 2000 election where Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College. I believe that the Electoral College destroys some of the integrity of the american democracy. I believe this is due to the winner takes all system of the Electoral College.\\n\\nThe Electoral College says whoever has the majority of votes in a state receives all that states votes. I believe this corrupts the system because so many peoples votes go unaccounted. If one party has 51 percent of the vote the other 49 percent of the votes don't count. This is why I believe that we need to abolish the Electoral College.\\n\\nIn a true democracy the people vote for a president and the ideal behind the Electoral College is that it eliminates uneducated votes. I believe that it doesn't do this very well and may actually harm the system even more. Peoples votes elect electors who elect the President in the Electoral College system. These electors are put in a spot of significant power. The question is who are these electors. It is very possible that they can vote for the opposite party of that which they were elected to vote for. Scandals like this have occurred in the past what is stopping them form continuing in the future.\\n\\nAnother major problem of the Electoral College is with the winner takes all system if a state is known to be a majority one party or another there is no use for someone in the minority party to vote because they have no effect. This allows citizens who are supposed to help elect Americas leaders to be unable to have any say in the government. The ideal behind a democracy is that the people rule and the Electoral College is destroying the democracy because it is restricting people form taking active participation in what they are entitled too as a citizen. Without the Electoral College there might be some uneducated votes but the popular vote upholds the integrity of the democracy that America thrives on. The popular vote also eliminates the chance of any major scandals that could majorly affect the presidential election.\",\n",

For him to hear all of our opinions it encouraged him to come back, so because of that he never snuck out again.\\n\\nSecond, others opinions can keep you out of harms way. For instance, many middle school kids can easily get persuaded in to doing things that can put them in extreme danger, but as long as you have excelent friends they can make sure you don\\'t get hurt, Now and days kids do not care about their actions, and they don\\'t understand that they are able to get hurt or get others hurt. That\\'s why so many people are dying because the only opinions people care about is how they look, or how nice their clothes are meanwhile we have people that are doing stupid things and are in danger because no one really cares what others do. Everyone can always get persuaded into doing things, yet still can\\'t get influenced to pick their life over harmful substances or choices.\\n\\nFinally, your oinions can help others like your family members stay on the right path in life. For example, my mom was hanging out with the wrong group of people, so they made her try different things she never did before, and because of that she chose the wrong life style to live and it had her going in and out of jail. Since she had four kids we kind of pushed her to get her life, and decisions on the right track and it helped her. Everytime we saw her all of my siblings would give their opinions, she may have not liked what we said, but she knew it was to help her get her life together.\\n\\nTherefore anything you say to someone can change their whole life around.\\n\\nTo sum it up, sometimes seeking multiple opinions can help you make better decisions like if you are doing something you are not suppose to be doing, their opinions can keep you safe, and it can help you stay on the right track. I feel like it is wonderful to get more than one opinion because sometimes one person\\'s opinion can\\'t always make you change your mind, and it is also more helpful to get more than one perspective.',\n",
       " 'There are several advantages in limiting car usage. It helps the environment, lowers the chance of crashing, removes stress, and also congestion.\\n\\nA reason why limiting car usage is beneficial is that it helps the environment. In source 2, France reached several days of \"near-record pollution\". This is mainly because of the substantial numbers of cars in France. Since France is dependent more on Diesel rather than gasoline, it emits more pollution causing smog to be more evident. In paragraph 14, it states, \"...[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.\". China has far more than triple the population of France. Yet, France is able to reach the same level of smog as China. If an abundant amount of people continue to drive cars as the way they do, every country is going to have the smog problem Beijing and France are having. Also possessing so much smog is a safety hazard being that it limits your ability to see from a distance.\\n\\nIn addition, limiting car usage can reduce stress. In source 1, Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, said \" When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way.\". In source 3, Carlos Artuto Plaza quotes \" its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution\". It is not only one person who can vouch on the reduction of stress by limiting car usage. A woman in Germany and a man in Colombia can both agree on the idea that limting car usage reduces stress. When you dont drive a car as much you have less things to worry about. Like, Fearing the possibilty of crashing, running out of gas, dealing with traffic, and several more problems. If someone drives less you would have less stress (in theory). The idea of stress reduction is an amazing advantage someone recieves if they limit their car usage.\\n\\nReducing car usage can also lower congestion. In source 2, \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france, after 5 days of intensyfying smog...\". The implication of limited car usage brought the congestion down 60 percent. That is a major advantage since there is a decrease in the number of cars on the streets. This reduces traffic and allows people to reach their destination sooner than they would if it was more congested. The drop in congestion means that there are less cars on the streets so there would be a lesser chance of crashing. This is a factor that can reduce stress. The reduction of congestion is a positive product of the limitation of car use.\\n\\nIn closing, the limitation of car usage gives the advantage of aiding the environment, reducing the likelihood of crashing, stress, and congestion.

       " \"Working in groups or working alone both have their distinct advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, working in groups can provide support, collaboration, and the potential for great ideas to come out of open discussion. On the other hand, individual work can foster autonomy, a higher degree of creativity, and focus on specific tasks. Ultimately, the decision of which approach to take depends heavily on the individual. Experiences can change an individual's perspective on which approach yields better results. A person who was successful in completing a project on their own might find more solace in individual work, while a person who was part of a successful team project may favor the benefits of working in a group environment.\",\n",

I belive we waste time and money on Venus where it could be used on existing problems and studies on a planet where it will be moost effective.\\n\\nOne portion of the passage that the author tried to push in your face was the fact that Venus had/has a great deal of geographical similarities to Earth. He said thisngs such as \" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size\"\\n\\nwhich appeal to a certain group of individuals who are afcinated by the thought of there being somewhere else like earth. The author also says \" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.\" This also would appeal to that same group of pepole giving them the thought that they are going to be able to live on Venus but still there are the harsh living conditions that contrdict that thinking.\\n\\nIn opposition to what the author says about Venus and its geographical similarites we also need to talk about the differences that cause problems not only for living on the planet but also studying it. Venus has an atmosphere that is \"97 percent carbondioxide\"\\n\\nwhich alone has ended the thought that Venus can any longer sustain life as they think i could before. Also the atmosphere makes it hard to even get any documentation on how the planet looks. In paragraph 7 the author uses the substance silicon carbide as an example of a way to get around the crazy atmoshpere but this leads me to my next point that the author failed to even mention in the passage, all of this study and exploration costs money.\\n\\nThe author forgot to mention one of the most cruccial pecies to the equation which is where is funding coming from and where could the money be used more effectivly.

       " \"Hey there! So, like, when people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person, right? And that's actually a pretty smart thing to do. See, when you're trying to make a big decision, it's important to get lots of different perspectives. That way, you can make a way better choice.\\n\\nLet me give you an example. Like, say you're trying to decide which new video game to buy. You could just ask your best friend who's really into gaming, and they might tell you that the new Call of Duty is the bomb dot com. But, if you also ask your sibling who's more into sports games, they might tell you that the new FIFA is where it's at. And then, if you ask your parents, they might have a different opinion altogether. Maybe they think you should get a game that's more educational, like a history or science game.\\n\\nSo, by asking multiple people, you get to see all these different viewpoints. And that helps you make a way more informed decision. You can consider all the different opinions and choose the game that's best for you.\\n\\nAnother reason seeking multiple opinions is helpful is that it can help you avoid bias. Like, if you only ask one person, they might have a certain viewpoint that's not really objective. But, if you ask a bunch of people, you're more likely to get a well-rounded view.\\n\\nFor example, let's say you're trying to decide which college to go to. You could ask your guidance counselor, and they might have a bunch of great reasons why you should go to the local state school. But, if you also ask a family friend who went to a different college, they might have a different perspective. They might tell you about all the amazing opportunities their college has, and how it's worth considering.\\n\\nSo, by seeking multiple opinions, you can get a better idea of what's out there. And, you can make a choice that's truly the best for you.\\n\\nIn conclusion, seeking multiple opinions is a super smart way to make better decisions.

       " \" The topic of extracurricular activities and their impact on students is a widely debated one. While some argue that schools should control students' involvement in such activities, I believe that the decision should be left to the students themselves. This is because extracurricular activities play a crucial role in helping students learn how to manage their time effectively, make new friends, and increase their chances of getting into college.\\n\\nFirstly, extracurricular activities can help students develop important time management skills. By participating in such activities, students are forced to create a schedule and prioritize their tasks. This can help them learn how to effectively manage their time and become more responsible. Additionally, extracurricular activities can help students develop a sense of commitment and follow-through, which are valuable skills that will serve them well in the future.\\n\\nSecondly, extracurricular activities can provide students with an opportunity to make new friends and develop important social skills. By participating in activities with like-minded individuals, students can learn how to communicate effectively and build strong relationships. This can help them develop a sense of belonging and improve their overall well-being.\\n\\nFinally, extracurricular activities can help students increase their chances of getting into college. Many colleges look at extracurricular activities as a way to gauge a student's interests, dedication, and potential. By participating in activities that align with their interests and passions, students can demonstrate to colleges that they are well-rounded and have a lot to offer.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe that the decision regarding extracurricular activities should be left to the students themselves. By allowing students to choose their own activities, we can help them develop important skills, make new friends, and increase their chances of success in the future.\",\n",
       " 'For many students, staying two extra hours in school is a challenge. Having an extra two hours tacked onto the regular school day puts an undue burden on students who may already be lacking in energy or time. Having a full day of school can take a toll on students’ physical and mental energy, and asking them to stay two additional hours with limited resources can be overwhelming. \\n\\nFor instance, students who are already feeling overwhelmed by academic tasks may reach a breaking point when faced with the option of staying for an additional two hours of school. While it may not seem like much time, it can be the tipping point between feeling exhausted and feeling overwhelmed. Moreover, staying an extra two hours in school can also make it more difficult for those with after-school commitments to honor outside obligations or just spend time with family. \\n\\nThe lack of time and energy can also have a psychological effect on students. If they are not able to stay the extra two hours, they may feel a sense of guilt or disappointment. It can be emotionally challenging for students to leave school in the middle of a lesson and feel like they are letting both themselves and the teacher down. \\n\\nIn conclusion, staying an extra two hours in school can be an incredibly stressful experience for students who may already be feeling overwhelmed or struggling to manage their time and energy. Not being able to stay for those extra two hours can have both physical and psychological consequences.

       " 'Honesty is a fundamental value that many of us hold dear, but it can also be a difficult choice when it comes to our relationships with family and friends. On one hand, being honest can lead to stronger bonds and increased trust, but on the other hand, it can also cause hurt and tension. In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of being honest with family and friends, and how lying can impact relationships and the future.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of being honest with family and friends is that it can lead to stronger relationships. When we are honest with those we care about, we show that we trust and respect them. This can lead to a deeper connection and understanding between the two parties. Additionally, honesty can help to avoid misunderstandings and miscommunications, which can ultimately lead to a stronger bond.\\n\\nHowever, being honest can also have its drawbacks. For example, it can sometimes be uncomfortable to share certain information with family and friends, especially if it is something that may cause them pain or discomfort. In these situations, it may be easier to simply avoid the topic altogether, rather than causing unnecessary tension. Additionally, being too honest can sometimes come across as blunt or insensitive, which can further damage relationships.\\n\\nLying, on the other hand, can be a way to avoid difficult conversations and maintain a sense of harmony in relationships. However, it can also have negative consequences. For example, lying can lead to a lack of trust and understanding, as the person being lied to may feel betrayed and hurt. Additionally, lying can cause tension and conflict, as the person being lied to may become suspicious and confrontational.\\n\\nIn the future, the impact of honesty and lying on relationships can be significant. If we choose to be honest with those we care about, we can build stronger bonds and avoid misunderstandings. However, if we choose to lie, we risk damaging trust and causing tension that may be difficult to repair. Ultimately, the choice to be honest or not depends on the individual and the specific situation at hand.\\n\\nIn conclusion, being honest with family and friends has its advantages and disadvantages. While it can lead to stronger relationships and increased trust, it can also be uncomfortable and cause tension. Lying, on the other hand, can be a way to avoid difficult conversations, but it can also lead to a lack of trust and conflict.',\n",

Students do not yet know the value of their education so it would be wise to not allow phones at all.\\n\\nPolicy 1 doesn't sound like a good idea. If you allow students to have their phones at certain times in the day, then most students will just use their phone discreetly throughout the day. Some students might have a different lunch time than other students and will try to text someone that is in class. Well I can hear you trying to say that students will have their phones turned off, now how many students would actually do that?\\n\\nPolicy 2 keeps the phones away from most students. I'm sure you will have a couple students that don't follow this policy, but that is what discipline is for. Cell phones are a big problem at school. Students want to socialize more than they want to learn. Now cell phones are becoming an even bigger problem. This new revolution is called internet and gaming phones. Now students can get cellular devices that have games on them. What is more distracting than a nice, fun flash game in the middle of a seemingly never-ending, boring class?\\n\\nThe internet is another big problem because if students have their phones during a test then they can look up the answer to a question on the internet. Sure you can set up a WEP key for the WiFi, but kids can still get internet through 3G or 4G coverage. Some phones do not even need the internet to get answers to questions, they just have apps for it. This could turn into a giant problem because finals would no longer be about what you learned, but more about how fast you could look it up on your phone. You cant have that kind of cheating on SATs or other important tests.\\n\\nI think a no phone policy would be ideal for the school. Not just because it would keep students from getting too distracted, but also because it would keep students from cheating on important tests. The look of the school to parents and government officials is key so you don't want students walking around texting all day. You have to keep up your test scores and phones would not help that.

       " \"As an 8th grader, I believe that having a four day school week can have several disadvantages. While it may seem like a convenient and energizing schedule, it can actually hinder students' abilities to participate in extracurricular activities, work part-time jobs, and help with younger siblings.\\n\\nFirstly, a four day school week can limit students' opportunities to participate in sports, clubs, and other activities that are crucial for their personal growth and development. Many students rely on these activities to help them relax and de-stress after a long week of school, but with only four days, they may not have enough time to attend practices or meetings. For example, I am a member of the school's robotics club, and I find that I don't have enough time to work on our projects or attend meetings during the four day week. This can be really frustrating and can impact my performance in the club.\\n\\nSecondly, a four day school week can make it difficult for students to work part-time jobs. Many students rely on these jobs to help pay for expenses such as textbooks, transportation, and other necessities. However, with only four days, they may not have enough time to work their shifts or complete their tasks. For instance, I have a part-time job at a local library, and I find that I don't have enough time to complete my tasks during the four day week. This can be really challenging and can impact my ability to save money for college.\\n\\nThirdly, a four day school week can limit students' ability to help with younger siblings. Many students have younger siblings who rely on them for help with homework, transportation, and other tasks. However, with only four days, students may not have enough time to help their siblings with their needs. For example, my little sister is in kindergarten, and she relies on me to help her with her homework and other tasks. However, during the four day week, I don't have enough time to help her, which can be really stressful for both of us.\\n\\nIn contrast, the benefits of a four day school week are not as significant as the disadvantages. While it may conserve energy and resources, it can also impact students' ability to learn and retain\",\n",
       " \"High school is an important milestone in a young person's life, and it is generally accepted that a four-year program is the appropriate timeframe for most students to achieve the necessary skills needed for college and to prepare for adult life. Although some may suggest that having students complete their high school education in three years instead of four could provide cost savings and reduce the number of dropouts, this would come with a number of cons.\\n\\nTo begin, a shorter graduation timeframe could lead to an increased number of unprepared students entering college. Without a full four years of high school, students would miss out on the full range of classes and experiences that are part of a standard high school education. For example, there may not be enough time to take the full sequence of math classes, like Algebra II or Calculus, or lab science classes like Chemistry and Biology. These classes are essential for many college majors, and without them, students would not be adequately prepared to take on the coursework for college-level classes.\\n\\nAdditionally, reduced opportunities could result from having students graduate early. With fewer years to experience high school, students may not have enough time to take advantage of extracurricular activities and clubs, such as student government or volunteering, or to make connections with teachers and classmates that could be used as references for college or job applications.\\n\\nFinally, some research has shown that coming from an extended high school experience may make it more likely for students to successfully finish college. Without the full four years of a high school education, students may struggle to adjust to the rigors of college.\\n\\nIn conclusion, although there may be initial cost savings from having students graduate from high school in three years, there can be unintended consequences that could impede the success of students both in college and in their later careers. It is therefore important to consider the potential drawbacks of an accelerated high school experience before implementing such a change.\",\n",

And adding a extracurricular activity and homework it would be kaous, and dont even get me started on how exzosted students would be. For example My oldest sister, Lindsay who did more than one Extracurricular Acitivitys like Chearleading, Swim, and Archery had her grades go down which leades me to my second reason Grades.\\n\\nSome students such as my self have end up not doing very well in school when we do a extracurruclar acitivity and a second one outside of school such as the ones I did Foot Ball, Archery, and Boy Scouts which is very hard to do when you add homework to it and you want to do good at the sports that you do aswell trust me it is very hard.\\n\\nNext reason I have is what if you are injured or disabaled and don't plan on doing year book after doing a difrent acitivity earlearer in the year with all the frends that you had made while doing the acitivity with them and yet you would have to leave them just because you had broken a bone or sprained your arm or leg because you would have to do an Extracurricular Acitivity because that is the school rule.\\n\\nSo bacicley what I am trying to say is that it might not be the best idea to make every student do a extra curicular acitivity due to all the reasonsi have and the many reasons that my fellow students have as well so i would apreaciate it if you would re consider\",\n",

First of all, it helps reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, which are like, really bad for the environment. When we use less energy, we produce less waste and less pollution, which makes our air cleaner and our planet healthier. Plus, conserving energy and resources saves us money! Like, who doesn't love saving money, right? 💸\\n\\nBut, let's be real, conserving energy and resources isn't always easy.  It can be kind of hard to change our habits and be more mindful of how we use energy and resources. Like, I know I'm guilty of leaving the lights on when I leave a room, or using way too much water when I shower.  But, it's important to be aware of our habits and make changes to be more eco-friendly.\\n\\nSo, here are some things I plan to do to conserve energy and resources:\\n\\n* Turn off lights and electronics when I'm not using them. It's like, common sense, right? But, I'll make sure to do it more often.\\n* Take shorter showers. I know, I know, it's not the most fun thing to do, but it's good for the environment and my water bill. 💦\\n* Use reusable bags and containers. Like, I know it's cool to use those fancy reusable bags, but I'll make sure to use them more often for grocery shopping and stuff.\\n* Use energy-efficient light bulbs. They're like, way more expensive than regular light bulbs, but they last longer and use less energy. It's like, a win-win! 💡\\n\\nIn conclusion, conserving energy and resources is super important for our planet and our future. It's not always easy, but it's worth it. So, let\",\n",

In other words when they grow up their kids will follow their footsteps. Now some of my friends think it's really important and that others should do it. On the otherhand my other friends think it's a waste of their time. So we kind of had a debate about it and came across some reasons why we should and why we shouldn't perform community service.\\n\\nStudents should perform community service because they are helping out the community THEY live in. So its like helping a family member out and at the same time being polite and having manners. And some schools require community service. I know our school requires community service when you make it on to arista. But the problem is that when you actually make it onto arista you only need to perform community service if you want to be in the ceremony and be accepted into arista. I think community service should be required to graduate. That would have everybody making time for it.\\n\\nNow the reasons other people don't want to do it is because they think it's not mandatory. And the other reason why they don't want to it is because they have no time and they need to do homework or study or they have practice for games.

       " 'The age of cars has come to a grinding stop. Atleast, That\\'s what the general consensus of these 4 articles seems to be. Although current youth do not see car buying as a major thing in their lives right now, it is highly unlikely it will remain as such because of the structure of an average american lifestyle.\\n\\nCars are a massive staple of the world and hold many things together and allow for fast, easy, convenient travel. The young people of today do not currently have to use cars to get where they are going because of many factors such as friends with cars, human powered forms of transportation such as bicycles, skateboards, etc.and pareits with cars. Once these children move away from home to a college or to a job elsewhere they will need a car to maintain a normal lifestyle. We are currently in a second babyboom, this means that there are many young people that do not need cars and thus do not have one, swaying the data away from the \"car culture\". While it is true that some people are trying to reduce their \"carbon footprint\" by driving less and using public transportation, the number of them is very small and irrelevant when compared to all people in the world. Cars maintain a large amount of appeal that cannot be found in any other form of transportation: This appeal is that it is your vehicle, to do whatever you want with and be free, it is also easy and convenient to get from place to place, it is a place to hang out with your friends andor a significant other, it is also faster than any other form of transportation short of a helicopter or plane. Cars have so many benefits that people will not just quit driving because of increased carbon emissions, most of which is not entirely the fault of cars.\\n\\nWhile cars do put out a large amount of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, that amount is inconsequential compared to the massive amou its of carbon dioxide emitted by volcanos and by other human creations. One volcanic eruption emits around the same amount of carbon dioxide in a few hours as the entire country of America does in 1015 years. Cars are not the true issue here, the main reason carbon dioxide is on tthe rise is because of the lack of trees and worldwide deforestation. All plant life can convert carbon dioxide into oxygen during photosynthesis, this means that more plant life equals less carbon dioxide. Instead of trying to reduce the number of cars in the world and make life harder on many people, the focus of the world should be to increase the amount of vegetation in the world so as to counterbalance the number of cars in the world.\\n\\nCars have long been an important factor in the world social, political, and economical structure. Before the second World War, Fuhrer Adolf Hitler decided that his people needed a cheap, basic car so as to increase Germany\\'s economic prowess. Due to this vision Volkswagen, The people\\'s car, was started. Volkswagen marked the start of cheap, affordable cars for everyday people. Although Germany lost World War II, their technology and ideas diffused to much of the world thanks to American and Soviet research. Their idea of a people\\'s car spread around the world and the 1950\\'s marked the start of massive sprawling suburbs that relied on personal vehicles to get to and from work, the store, school, or anywhere outside of the suburbs. This was a totally new type of lifestyle It wasn\\'t urban life where you could walk or ride a bus wherever you needed, and it wasn\\'t rural where you made everything by hand and didnt travel often. No, this was something entirely new that was brought about because of the advent of cheap affordable personal transportation. Now everyone can get to work relying on only themselves and not bus drivers or train operators, people have a new sense of freedom afforded them by this magnificent new machine, the car.\\n\\nThe same ideas and principles that made cars such an important part of culture and life in the 1950\\'s still remain in our lives today. Cars will remain an important part of world culture until another form of transportation is easier, more convenient, andor cheaper. A car gives its driver a fast, freeing, and flexible form of transportation unparalleled by anything today. Car use should not be limited, it should be encouraged.',\n",

I think it's super important to weigh the pros and cons of each and figure out how teachers can make group work the best it can be. 🤔\\n\\nFirst off, let's talk about the advantages of working in a group. 🤝 When we work together, we can bounce ideas off each other and come up with way more creative solutions than we could on our own. Plus, it's way more fun! 🎉 We can learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses, and support each other when things get tough. Group work also helps us develop important social skills like communication, collaboration, and problem-solving. 💡\\n\\nBut, there are also some downsides to group work. 🤔 Sometimes, people don't pull their weight and the project doesn't get done as well as it could have. Or, people might not agree on what to do and it can get super confusing. 🤯 It's important for teachers to find ways to prevent these problems from happening. 💡\\n\\nSo, how can teachers facilitate group work in their classes? 🤔 First, they should make sure everyone knows their role and what's expected of them. That way, everyone's on the same page and can work together effectively. Next, teachers should give groups plenty of time to work on their project and check in with them regularly to make sure they're on track. 🕒 Finally, teachers should encourage open communication and problem-solving among groups, so they can work together to overcome any challenges they face. 💬\\n\\nNow, here are three reasons why teachers should encourage students to work in groups: 🤔\\n\\n1.

       " \"In today's fast-paced world, it's easy to become overwhelmed with the demands of daily life. Whether it's school, work, or extracurricular activities, it can be hard to find the time to do everything we want to do. However, I believe that we can accomplish more if we are doing something than if we remain idle.\\n\\nFirstly, when we are actively engaged in a task, we are able to focus our energy and attention on that task. This allows us to put our best effort into it and achieve our goals more effectively. For example, when studying for an exam, it's much more productive to actively review the material and take notes than it is to simply read over the textbook. By actively engaging in the task, we are able to better understand and retain the information, leading to better grades on the exam.\\n\\nSecondly, being active can help us to overcome procrastination. Procrastination can be a major obstacle to achieving our goals, as it often leads to wasted time and missed opportunities. By engaging in a task, we are able to make progress and see tangible results, which can motivate us to continue working towards our goals. For example, when working on a group project, it can be tempting to put off starting until the last minute. However, by actively engaging in the task and making progress early on, we can avoid the stress and pressure of rushing to complete the project before the deadline.\\n\\nFinally, being active can also help us to improve our mental and physical health. When we are idle, we may become bored or restless, which can lead to negative emotions such as anxiety and depression. By engaging in a task, we are able to keep our minds and bodies active and healthy. For example, exercise has been shown to improve mood, reduce stress, and boost overall well-being.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe that we can accomplish more if we are doing something than if we remain idle. By actively engaging in a task, we are able to focus our energy and attention, overcome procrastination, and improve our mental and physical health. So the next time you find yourself feeling overwhelmed, try to find a task to engage in and see the difference it can make.\",\n",
       " \"If someone wants to grow more as a person, they will have to try different things. I believe that Ralph Waldo Emerson is right. To grow more as a person people have to try different things because the most things they do the more experience they get. If a person mastered something already he will feel that he know everything but the true is that he only know whay he mastered, but if a pereson try different thing he would get more experience that can be use in the future.\\n\\nan example of this is Pique. He is a famous soccer player. he get pay a lot of money, but to grow more as a person. he also become a busines man. Now Pique have a lot of companies that work for him. he also created his own Tennis league in Spainh. Pique also support a fundation that his wife created to help kids in Colombia.\\n\\nOther example is one of my uncles from Generic_City. his mane is Generic_Name. He study to be a teacher. He was very happy with his work, but to grow more and get more knowledge he go back to college to study to become a doctor. Now he feel like he know more and that he have grow more as a person.\\n\\nI also like to thing that I'm a example of this. I always try to do my best to leard different sports. I'm a really good soccer player, but I prefere to try others sports. I play a different sport everyday because I feel that this will help me to become a better player and will give me the experience to grow more as a athlete. I also like to to study a lot for the classes that I'm having problems because I get more knowledge about different topics and make me grow more as a student\\n\\n.\\n\\nPeople can still growing when they mastered something. An example of this is Leonel Messi. he is a soccer. he has play soccer all his life's. He always was getting better and better every year. he never play other sport in his life's. Now he is considere one of the best player in the world. He grow as a person by doing what he already mastered.\\n\\npeople have to do different things in their life's if they want to grow as a person because if they think they are the best is a lie. They are the best in what they mastered, but they don't have any type of knowledge in other thing. In conclution if someone wants to grow more as a person. He will has to try different things to get more experience and more knowledge.\",\n",
       " 'Taking in multiple people\\'s advice can benefit you in a variety of ways. As an example, most people take in more than one persons advice to see which would be the best advice for them,\\n\\nBecause some people give better advice than others. Another reason why people go to multiple people for advice is because, people thrive off of others opinion, you may not see it but when you give or take in others advice it can really benefit you or the significant other you gave advice to .Taking in multiple others advice is a plus because it helps you when you don\\'t know what you want to do and it gives you options to choose from.\\n\\nRoman philosopher Cicero said \"no one can give you wiser advice than yourself\",\\n\\nBut thats not necessarily true. Most people strive off of others ideas. Students at school have guidance counselors and teachers that they take advice from all of the time, and mostly it benefits them in numerous ways. Another benefit for asking more than one person for advice is one person may give you bad advice on purpose, but if you have a second option to go to hopefully you can figure out the best one.\\n\\nWhen I was about seven or eight me and my sister had psychologists, We would both talk to one of the psychologists at a time kind of in a rotation. They would both give different advice and one was not always better than the the others. Taking in advice from both of them really benefited me, they both had different ideas of what I should do. Yes I was only eight years old but I could understand where both of them were coming from. And I had multiple ideas to choose from, But sometimes I didnt really like the advice that they me so I went to mom for some I ideas.\\n\\nAdvice does not always have to be about your personal life though, Say your at the store with your friends. And you say \"do you think i should buy this shirt\" theres always gonna be that one friend that says \"yeah\\n\\n\\'\\'you have the money\". But theres gonna be your other friend that says \"can you picture yourself wearing it because i know that if i dont love it in the store it\\'s gonna just sit in my closet\" that actually happened to me once. I went with friends idea and saved a little bit of money doing so.\\n\\nAll and all taking advice from multiple people at once benefits citizens in numerous ways even me.\\n\\nwhen you take in in multiple others advice it is a plus, because it helps you when you do not know what you want to do and it gives you options to choose from. If you talk to more than one person for advice it may mean that you were unsure of the advice you were given the first time. I suggest you talk to multiple people before you make a decision especially if it is a big decision.',\n",
       " \"Hey, I'm like totally against the idea of extending school hours. I mean, I know some people might think it's a good idea to get more learning in, but I think it would be super lame.\\n\\nFirst of all, let's talk about how it would be harder for students to pay attention. Like, I already have trouble focusing in class sometimes, and if we had to be there even longer, I don't know how I would make it through. My brain would start to like, mush, or something. And who wants to be in a classroom for even longer when you're already feeling drained? Not me, that's for sure.\\n\\nAnd don't even get me started on how students would disrespect their teachers even more. I mean, I know some kids can be pretty rambunctious, but if we had to be in school longer, they would probably get even more rowdy. And I don't think teachers would be able to handle it. They already have a lot of work to do, and adding more hours to their day would be like, super unfair.\\n\\nBut you know what's even worse? The uprising among students. Like, if we had to be in school longer, there would probably be a ton of complaining and stuff. And honestly, I don't think it would be worth it. I mean, I'd rather have more free time to do things I actually enjoy, like playing video games or hanging out with my friends.\\n\\nSo, here's what I think we should do instead. Instead of making school hours longer, let's make the additional hours optional after-school activities. That way, students can choose to go to things like sports, clubs, or even just hang out in the library and read. It would be way more fun and engaging than just sitting in a classroom all day.\\n\\nPlus, think about how much more flexible it would be for students. Like, if they want to learn more about a certain subject, they could go to a club or activity that focuses on that. Or, if they just want to relax and do nothing, they could hang out in the library. It would be like, totally up to them.\\n\\nSo, there you have it. That's my argument against extending school hours.\",\n",
       " \"Hi, I'm a grade 7 student and I'm gonna argue against the use of animals in scientific research. I mean, I get that scientists wanna help people and make new medicines and stuff, but I don't think it's right to use animals to do it.\\n\\nFirst of all, animals have feelings too, you know? They feel pain, fear, and stress just like we do. Imagine if you were a mouse and some scientist was doing experiments on you, like injecting you with stuff or putting you in a cage with other animals that might hurt you. That would be really scary and sad, right?\\n\\nAnd it's not just that animals have feelings, but they also have rights. Just like how we have the right to live our lives and make our own choices, animals have the right to live their lives too. It's not fair to use them just because they're smaller or weaker than us.\\n\\nAnother thing is that animal testing isn't always necessary. Like, there are other ways to test things, like using cells or computers. And some scientists are already using those methods instead of animals. Plus, animal testing doesn't always work. Sometimes the results are different from what they would be in humans, so it's not always accurate.\\n\\nFinally, there are lots of other ways we can learn about science and medicine without using animals. We can study humans, or use machines, or even observe animals in their natural habitats. There are lots of alternatives that don't involve hurting animals.\\n\\nSo, that's why I think we shouldn't use animals in scientific research. It's not right to hurt them just to help us. We can find other ways that are more ethical and kind. Thanks for listening!\",\n",

I would personally prefer Policy 1, because if the students are responsible then they should be able to use there phones in free time such as lunch hour. Students should turn cell phones off in any hour of the day in which the are learning. If caught with phone on or still having the same texting conversations as lunch or previous periods then a proper form of punishment should be given. The reasons young adults should be given the choice to bring or not to bring their phones is because they need to know if you make a choice and get in trouble that they need to take the punishment.\\n\\nPolicy 2 is an unfair unlike Policy 1 which give us a choice. Policy 2 is like taking an agenda from a hard working lawyer or doctor. It is something they need to make through the day just as young adults need their phones. Us using our phones help us keep in touch with our parents like on game days and you are supposed to ride the bus and your parents need to find you. Now the phone usage on the bus is the same policy as the school. They always have those \"NO CELL PHONE USAGE\" signs up.\\n\\nI am coming to you with this letter because i believe students should be allowed to bring their phones to school if they are smart with it.

       " '\"All of our development since World War II has been centered around the car, and that will have to change,\" said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. David Goldberg says this in means of trying to decrease car usage, such as in Vauban, Germany. Car usage after World War II continued increasing for a long period of time until 2005 in the United States the number of miles driven started to decrease. In the year 2013, the miles driven in the United States decreased nearly 9% since 2005 and was equal to the amount of miles driven in 1995. Throughout the whole world people have been experiencing problems with air pollution and due to that many have been trying to decrease the usage of cars in different ways to slow this air pollution.\\n\\nTo start off, pollution from cars has been a large factor of the air pollution today. In the United States, 50 percent of the greenhouse emissions in the United States is caused by passenger cars. Then there is Paris who has been experiencing heavy smog. Recently, it has had days of near-record pollution. Reason for such high levels of smog or air pollution can be attributed to a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesel makes up 67% of vehicles in France. Then in the rest of Western Europe 53.3% of the vehicles are diesel.\\n\\nNext, is how some people attempt to slow the car pollution. The first example of a community trying to decrease the usage of cars is Vauban, Germany. In Vaubaun street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden. For the most part, Vauban is car free. The only way to use cars in Vauban is to carpool because there is only two places to park in the whole city and they are two large parking garages on the edge of development. Then you have to pay $40,000 to keep a spot. 70% of the people in Vaubaun do not own cars. Anoter example is Paris, who is one of the biggest air pollutants next to Beijing. They have been trying to decrease the smog in their area through slowing the amount of cars on the road. What they did is make it so only cars wih even-numbered license plates could drive one day and odd-numbered license plates the next. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined due to this policy, which showed some\\xa0 reluctance in following the plan. This did not matter though because the smog cleared enough to where the polcy only lasted for one day. Another attempt in lowering the usage of cars was Bogota\\'s car-free day. In this program it is quite obvious that it was just a day of no car usage at all. During this event Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work. Even in the rain people of Bogota participated in this event. Then there is one other case of lowering the usage of cars, which is the natural way, having people just grow away from the car. This is currently happening in the United States, one of if not the largest car users. Like I said earlier since 2005 the usage of cars has decreased. Whether this trend stays in motion or not depends on the idealism of the current and future generations.\\n\\nTo conclude, the use of cars is creating problems in air pollution and due to this there have been attempt to slow this usage. Then back to what David Goldberg said the development of the car needs to stop being the center of attention. So instead what we have to do is take our attention away from using the car to ways of finding ways to limit the cars use.    ',\n",

       " 'Do I think online classes would benefit students from being able to attend classes from home? Yes! I think it would actually be better for people 18. If you are 18 it gives you more free time to get a full time good paying job and you will still be able to go to school. It is not as hard on your body as going to school either, saying that meaning when you work and you go to school most days you would have to leave school and go straight to work. With online classes you can wake up for class do your work an when you finish you can go back to sleep until its time for you to go to work. Believe it or not you have more time to do your class work to, you can do it before you go to work or as soon it is given to you. You just have to know how to manage your time right and wanna do good in school and maintain a steady job.\\n\\nTaking online classes really gives you a lot of free time you just have to know what to do with it. If it was me who had a chance to take only online classes. I would get me a full time job some where and I would do both. when I say that I know it sounds stressful and hard to do but when you really put thought into it you would have time to do them both. Say if I was working over night I could wake up around Noon I could do my work and then I could go back to sleep and rest more before I go to work. I could really picture that working out.\\n\\nIf someone is to try this with online classes it world be easier on their body because, you dont have to wake up and go to school and stay up all day and then go to work you can rest a little more before you go to work. Then you are not gonna be tired at work you can come home and sleep and then you dont have to wake up early after you get off of work late. You may not know it but rest is a big thing I never understood that until I got a job an now that I am not getting that much sleep I realized that your body needs rest because without rest your body is not right until you get the rest you need.\\n\\nThe good part about the whole thing is that you will have a lot more time to do your classwork. I am\\xa0not talking about a hour of class time im talking about you can sit down and finish all of your work at your own pace you will get much more done in less time and you will still have more free time. you will still be able to enjoy yourself on your days off with no school work or if you have some you have not done you can do it on your days you have off. Honestly its a lot\\xa0of ways you can go about having online classes a lot of people can have a lot of different ways to look at this but this is just the way I look at it. If i was to ever get the chance to do online classes I would take this route and try to maintain a job and school at the same time i am not really sure why this is just how I would go about it.\\n\\nIn conclusion\\xa0if you are in high school an they offer online classes for people almost done with school take them up on that because it would push you harder to graduate letting you know that your almost there. some people might thing school is easier but everyone opinion is different. My opinion would be what i talked about in my paper which is to take the online classes an get you a job so therefore you could work and make money while you not in school. And if thats not what you want\\xa0to do just fine something out in the world productive to do for the time you are taking those online classes. I am almost sure if your 18 and you are taking online classes\\xa0or is almost finish high school you can probably take collage courses for the time being just to get a head start\\xa0on your life after high school.',\n",

Occupation opportunity's will be given more to those who have done this helpful deed. Lastly, these students will be known and loved in and by the community for their time and effort.\\n\\nStudents start to think about college when they hit 6th grade. So that's seven years of stress that could be decreased by knowing they have community service to put on their college application. This will get students more aware and ready for their college future . Most colleges need some kind of curricular activity and community service so the best way to get that done with is to have that as a requirement to graduate high school.\\n\\nAfter college students will be all on there own. To support themselves they'll need a job. Appling application after application could take these new adults forever to get a job if they didn't have community service to put on those applications. Your choice could effect hundreds of students jobs and how they will live for the rest of their life. For an occupation that pays the way to live needs people who have helped in a community. So lets give these future scholars a chance to make a living.\\n\\nOur community would be destroyed without the help of those who give up their time to help. Small towns like ours need the small and big things done to keep it a town.

       " 'In modern society, cars have become a necessity for most citizens, especially in urban areas. However, the overuse of cars can lead to a variety of problems, including pollution, traffic congestion, and health issues. Therefore, limiting car usage is essential for improving the quality of life for citizens. This essay will explain the advantages of limiting car usage, as supported by ideas and information from multiple sources.\\n\\nFirstly, reducing car usage can significantly decrease air pollution. According to a report by the World Health Organization, air pollution is responsible for seven million premature deaths worldwide each year. In urban areas, cars are one of the main sources of air pollution, as they emit harmful gases such as nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide. These gases not only harm the environment but also have negative effects on human health, including respiratory problems and cancer. By limiting car usage, citizens can contribute to reducing air pollution and improving the overall health of the community.\\n\\nSecondly, limiting car usage can reduce traffic congestion, which is a common problem in urban areas. According to a study by the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, traffic congestion costs the United States billions of dollars each year in lost productivity and wasted fuel. Moreover, traffic congestion can cause stress and frustration for drivers, leading to road rage and accidents. By reducing car usage, citizens can reduce traffic congestion, save time and money, and promote safer roads for all.\\n\\nLastly, limiting car usage can encourage a more active and healthy lifestyle. Walking and cycling are excellent forms of exercise that can improve physical health and mental well-being. By reducing car usage, citizens can increase their daily physical activity, which can help prevent obesity, heart disease, and other health problems. Additionally, walking and cycling are often cheaper and more sustainable than driving, which can save money and reduce the carbon footprint.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for citizens, including reducing air pollution, reducing traffic congestion, and promoting a healthier lifestyle. Therefore, it is essential for citizens to consider alternatives to driving, such as walking, cycling, and public transportation. By making small changes in our daily lives, we can contribute to a cleaner, safer, and more sustainable future for all.',\n",
       " 'Standardized testing has been a topic of debate for many years, and it is still a controversial issue today. Some people believe that standardized tests are an accurate measure of student ability, while others argue that they are not. In my opinion, standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability.\\n\\nOne reason why I believe that standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability is that they do not take into account the different learning styles and abilities of students. Every student has a unique way of learning, and some students may not perform well on standardized tests because the tests do not cater to their learning style. For example, a student who is a visual learner may struggle with a standardized test that is primarily focused on reading comprehension.\\n\\nAnother reason why I believe that standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability is that they do not assess all of the skills that a student possesses. Standardized tests typically focus on reading, writing, and math skills, but they do not assess other important skills such as creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving. These skills are just as important as the skills that are assessed on standardized tests, and they should be taken into consideration when evaluating a student\\'s ability.\\n\\nFurthermore, standardized tests can be biased against certain groups of students. For example, students who come from low-income families or who speak English as a second language may not perform as well on standardized tests because the tests are not culturally relevant to them. This can lead to a situation where students who are actually very capable are labeled as \"low-performing\" simply because they did not do well on a test that was biased against them.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe that standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability. They do not take into account the different learning styles and abilities of students, they do not assess all of the skills that a student possesses, and they can be biased against certain groups of students. Instead of relying solely on standardized tests, we should use a variety of assessment methods to evaluate student ability, including portfolios, projects, and performance-based assessments. By doing so, we can get a more accurate picture of what each student is capable of and help them to reach their full potential.',\n",

The electoral college was established by our founding fathers, and still benefits us today. Using trusted representatives and efficently casting the desired vote, the electoral college is the best method of selecting a president. The electoral college allows the country to be sure of an outcome, and no one region can elect a president on its own.\\n\\nElectoral votes are cast by electors chosen to represent each state, these electors are \"...trusted to vote for the party\\'s nominee...\", stated Richard Posner. This means\\xa0that electors are trusted and qualified to efficiently represent the vote their state desires. The trust set upon electors is \"rarely betrayed\" Posner said. The last time an election was won by someone who didn\\'t get the popular vote was in 2000, and this doesn\\'t happen often. This is contrary to what was said by Bradford Plumer. Plumer stated \"The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse.\"\\n\\nThe electoral college gives America certainty of an outcome, without a tie, or a run-off election. The ability to rest easy knowing there will be a clear winner is an ability given to America, by the system of electoral votes. \\xa0A tie occurance in an election is \"Highly unlikely...\" Posner said.

       " \"When people are faced with a difficult decision, it can be helpful to seek the advice of others. However, talking to just one person may not be enough to make a well-informed choice. This is why seeking multiple opinions can be beneficial.\\n\\nOne reason why seeking multiple opinions is helpful is because it allows the person to gather different perspectives. Each individual has their own unique experiences and knowledge, and by talking to multiple people, the person can gain a more complete understanding of the situation. For example, if someone is trying to decide whether to pursue a career in medicine or law, talking to both a doctor and a lawyer can provide insight into the pros and cons of each profession.\\n\\nIn addition, seeking multiple opinions can help the person identify any biases or blind spots they may have. It's common for people to have certain assumptions or preconceptions, and talking to others can help them see things from a different angle. For instance, if someone is considering buying a car, they may have a preference for a certain brand or model. However, by talking to people who have owned different types of cars, they may realize that their preferred brand or model may not be the best choice for their needs.\\n\\nLastly, seeking multiple opinions can help the person feel more confident in their decision. When people have considered all the options and have heard different perspectives, they are more likely to feel that they have made an informed choice. This can also help them avoid any regrets or second-guessing in the future.\\n\\nIn conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can be helpful because it allows the person to gather different perspectives, identify any biases or blind spots, and feel more confident in their decision. It's important to remember that everyone has their own unique experiences and knowledge, and talking to multiple people can provide a more complete understanding of the situation.\",\n",
       " \"Kindness is a concept that has been debated for centuries. It is often defined as the quality or disposition of being friendly, generous, and considerate towards others. However, the true meaning of kindness can vary from person to person.\\n\\nOne reason why people choose to be kind and give back to others is because it makes them feel good. Acting kindly towards others can bring a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment. Additionally, kindness can also improve one's own well-being by reducing stress and anxiety. When we are kind to others, we release feel-good hormones such as oxytocin, which can improve our mood and overall sense of happiness.\\n\\nKindness can also have a significant impact on the people around us. When we are kind to others, we can help them feel valued and appreciated. This can lead to improved relationships and a greater sense of belonging. Furthermore, kindness can also have a ripple effect, as kind actions can inspire others to do the same.\\n\\nEven small acts of kindness can have a large impact on others. For example, a simple smile or a compliment can brighten someone's day. Similarly, volunteering a few hours of time or donating a small amount of money can make a huge difference in someone's life.\\n\\nKindness is also important for overall well-being. Research has shown that kind people tend to have better physical and mental health than those who are less kind. Additionally, kind individuals tend to have more positive relationships and are better at managing stress.\\n\\nIn the long-term, kindness can have a significant impact on individuals and communities. When we are kind to others, we can help to create a more positive and supportive environment. This can lead to a greater sense of community and a more cohesive society.\\n\\nIn conclusion, kindness is an important concept that can have a significant impact on individuals and communities. By being kind to others, we can improve our own well-being and help to create a more positive and supportive environment. Whether it's a small act of kindness or a larger gesture, every act of kindness can make a difference.\",\n",

Character traits are influenced by various factors, including external factors such as parents, friends, and media. In this essay, I will explore the influences of character traits in human beings, analyze firsthand experiences and research studies to explain how these traits are influenced by external factors, and discuss effective methods for cultivating character.\\n\\nParents play a significant role in shaping the character traits of their children. They are the first role models that children encounter, and their behavior and actions have a significant impact on the development of their children's character. Parents who exhibit positive traits such as kindness, honesty, and responsibility are more likely to raise children with these traits. On the other hand, parents who exhibit negative traits such as selfishness, dishonesty, and irresponsibility are more likely to raise children with these traits.\\n\\nFriends also play a crucial role in shaping the character traits of individuals. Friends are a significant source of socialization and influence, and their behavior and actions can have a significant impact on the development of an individual's character. Friends who exhibit positive traits such as loyalty, empathy, and respect are more likely to influence individuals to develop these traits. On the other hand, friends who exhibit negative traits such as bullying, dishonesty, and selfishness are more likely to influence individuals to develop these traits.\\n\\nMedia also plays a role in shaping the character traits of individuals. The media, including television, movies, and social media, can have a significant impact on the development of an individual's character. Media that promotes positive traits such as kindness, honesty, and responsibility is more likely to influence individuals to develop these traits. On the other hand, media that promotes negative traits such as violence, greed, and selfishness is more likely to influence individuals to develop these traits.\\n\\nWhile external factors such as parents, friends, and media can influence the development of character traits, they can also hinder it. For example, parents who exhibit negative traits such as abuse, neglect, and criticism can hinder the development of positive character traits in their children. Friends who exhibit negative traits such as bullying, dishonesty, and selfishness can also hinder the development of positive character traits in individuals.

       " \"Should or Shouldn't drivers use devices while operating a vehicle? I think drivers shouldnt use any device while operating a vehicle. The reason being is because you can put yourself and others in serious danger. You using a device when you should be paying attention to the road can cost so much damage to things and others. No person should use no device especially if they have a child on board during driving time. You wouldn't want to hurt your child due to this dangerous thing to do. This type of thing had cost many car accidents which is likely 45% to happen of most accidents made because of the use of devices.\\n\\nIf you want to be able to use any device while driving , I think you should get something that's safer to use during your time of driving. Having a phone holder so that you wouldn't have to take your eyes off the road at any given moment . It's safe to use because you can still manage your driving and what you are trying to do on your device at the same time. You can still make phone calls and such things of that nature. A little more in depth on why this is still a dangerous thing to do. Many people that drives like teens the ages like 17 and older attend to use devices while toxicated or other things pertaining to that. This is more dangerous to use a device because you are unaware of everything going around you.\\n\\nThis is why most teens or adults have many accidents because of driving using a device while driving. While learning to drive there were no things saying to use a device while driving. You don't think about other lives while doing these dangerous things? To me I don't think so because therefore no accidents wouldn't be made because of this type of thing. I think if people did care everyone wouldn't use a device at all unless it's a safe device to use which is a blue tooth device. People need to follow rules more so that these things can be avoided. When you follow rules they stop a lot of things from preventing car accidents.\\n\\nI think people who use a device while driving and they cost a accident should have a serious consequence. They know on the road no device shouldn't be used because of what can happen to yourself and others around you. So when it happens they should get the full consequence that is because these things need to stop because people want to do things at the wrong given time. So this what should happen if the person are in the wrong.\\n\\nThis is why I think devices shouldn't be use during operating a vehicle because of all the things that can happen in my previous paragraphs. This should be put out more so that people can really abide by this so that it can and will prevent bad things from happening.                   \",\n",

       " 'It is important to understand that it is not beneficial to pair older kids with younger kids. To begin, it can be a dangerous situation for younger kids due to an unfair physical advantage. An older child may use this physical advantage to bully or harm a younger child or put them in dangerous situations without fully understanding the consequences. Secondly, an older child may provide a negative example to the younger child. Older kids may influence a younger child to participate in activities or make decisions that can have long-term effects. Lastly, older kids should respect younger kids and not view them as inferior or expendable -- they should be seen as peers in terms of respect and value. For example, an older kid should not spread rumors or gossip about a younger child, as this can lead to ostracism and other negative effects. Considering the potential dangers, and the need for respect, it is essential that older kids not be paired with younger kids.',\n",
       " '\"Distance learning,\" as defined by Merriam-Webster, is \"education imparted remotely via technological means.\" With the rise in technology, some schools are now offering this type of learning experience as an option for students to attend classes. As a student in grade 11, I believe that attending classes from home would be incredibly beneficial.\\n\\nFirst, attending classes from home would offer students a greater level of flexibility. For example, if a student needs to attend a doctor\\'s appointment, they can easily do so without worrying about missing a day of school. They can make up the work later at their own pace. Students who live in rural areas and have long commutes to school would also benefit from distance learning.\\n\\nAdditionally, students who have learning disabilities or are struggling academically would benefit greatly from being able to attend classes from home. They may feel more comfortable asking questions or seeking help in a one-on-one video conference with their teachers. Students who are easily embarrassed or shy in a classroom setting can feel at ease knowing that they aren\\'t in front of a large group of peers.\\n\\nHowever, there are potential drawbacks to distance learning. Some students may be more easily distracted when they are attending classes from home. It may be difficult to remain focused without the traditional structure of a classroom. Additionally, some students may miss the social interaction that comes with attending school. \\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe that offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes would be beneficial for both students and teachers. While there are potential drawbacks, the advantages of greater flexibility and individualized learning opportunities far outweigh the potential disadvantages.\"',\n",
       " \"In recent years, taking courses online from home has become increasingly popular for many students. Studying from home has numerous benefits that may make it better suited to certain individuals than attending school in person. For starters, online courses offer convenience and flexibility. Those with physical impairments or other long-term health issues can participate in classes without having to worry about getting to and from school. Additionally, there is often more variety when it comes to what courses are available online. For students who may be struggling academically, online courses allow for a more individualized learning experience and can provide extra help when needed.\\n\\nHowever, there are also some clear advantages to attending school in person. In a regular school environment, students get the opportunity to learn social skills and work with classmates on group projects. Interacting with peers and teachers on a daily basis can be beneficial for developing important skills like collaboration, communication, and problem-solving. Additionally, attending school in person can provide a sense of routine and can create a more rewarding educational experience. By taking part in classroom discussions and physical activities, students can gain a better understanding of the material they are studying. \\n\\nUltimately, there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to deciding between online courses and in-person education. It is important to consider both options seriously and factor in each student's individual abilities and preferences. Some may find that taking courses online from home is a better fit, while others may prefer the traditional school experience.\",\n",
       " \" In my opinion, praising can be a powerful tool to boost a student's self-esteem or to recognize and reward achievement. However, the way praising is used can have both positive and negative effects. A praising person can be a hero or a leader, but they can also use praising to express themselves or to ignore their own pain.\\n\\nPraising can be used as a means of achieving recognition and status in the world. For example, a firefighter who saves a burning house or a police officer who catches a criminal can be praised for their bravery and heroism. Similarly, people who help others in their daily lives, such as asking if they need help or offering a ride, can also be praised for their kindness and generosity.\\n\\nPraising can also be used as a tool for self-esteem. People who have low self-esteem may use praising to get their anger out on someone or to ignore their own pain. However, it is important to recognize that praising is not a substitute for therapy or other forms of self-care.\\n\\nOverall, praising can be a powerful tool for making the world a better place. By helping others and caring for each other, we can create a more friendly and welcoming environment for everyone. Whether it is through acts of kindness or recognition of achievement, praising can help us make a positive impact on the world around us.\",\n",

       " \"Students should be able to design their own school projects over the summer. Teachers have assigned all the work during the school year, so it'll be beneficial to the students in many ways if they design the project themselves. Especially when summer is for the students to relax, so them designing their own projects would be less stressful on them. It would give kids more incentive to complete it, it'll be completed more thoroughly, and it lets the student be mature and complete it all by themselves.\\n\\nHowever, some people might think it's more beneficial for the teacher to design the projects. The teachers know exactly what information to give and it'll most likely be geared to what they will be learning the upcoming semester. The project will also be very uniform because they will have specific points they want you to cover and a rubric to which you have to meet all requirements. On the other hand, students will be much more motivated to complete it thoroughly because they have designed the entire thing by themselves.\\n\\nFirst, this will give kids more incentive to actually complete the project. If the students get to design it themselves, it'll let them be creative which a lot of projects don't give. Even though the student is suppose to complete a project over the summer, doesn't mean that they will. No student wants to do a project thats cut and dry, if they are able to design it on their own it will give them more freedom and let them choose what they want to write about. They will also be able to collaborate with their friends and get ideas to make the project even more unique. If the kids actually get to do it all by themselves, they might actually want to do it and have fun while doing it.\\n\\nNext, the project will be geared towards what the student enjoys. This will ensure that the project will be thorough with lots of detail and done correctly. Giving students the option to complete it themselves gives them creativity which most school related work does not give. The kids can pick posters, slide shows, pod casts, interviews, animated stories, and much more. Letting them pick how to portray it lets them complete it in whichever platform they enjoy the most, so the project will be full of information and very well done. Teachers sometimes don't understand students need to be creative because they are still kids, giving them this option would allow the students to use their strengths and complete a very impressive project.\\n\\nLastly, this gives students the opportunity to be mature and fill the role of the teacher. Students never get to design their own projects, usually they just follow a specific rubric the teacher gives and the project is cut and dry. Allowing kids to create their own project forces them to be mature because they'll have no teacher assistance and it'll be completely up to them from start to finish. Doing this prepares the students for college, where most work is done completely by yourself with little to no teacher help. Clearly the student will have guidelines, but all the information, platform, design, and formatting will be completely up for them to decide. This'll help mentally prepare the student for what college is like where you learn to mature very quickly.\\n\\nStudent designed projects over the summer will be more beneficial than teacher designed projects. Teachers would be surprised how detailed and impressive the projects would be if the students were left to their own devices. It gives the kids more incentive to do it, it'll be geared towards their interests so it'll be more thorough, and it allows the student to learn a level of maturity. Throughout the school year students don't get to design any work, so teachers should give kids an opportunity to complete a project by themselves.\\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\",\n",

       " 'One of the most important factors in achieving success in life is having a positive attitude. Research shows that having a positive attitude can lead to tangible benefits, such as making a good impression on those around you and inspiring those around you to also be positive. Additionally, having a positive attitude can often lead to gaining favor from others, making it easier to achieve goals.\\n\\nHowever, there can be negative outcomes from having a positive attitude as well. For example, it is possible that one can be taken advantage of if they are always eager to help due to their positive attitude. Furthermore, jealousy can stem from one’s positivity if others have a negative attitude and cannot accept success achieved by someone else.\\n\\nWhile hard work is also essential to achieving success, it is important to note that having the right mindset also plays a major role. It has been found that those with a strong work ethic combined with a positive attitude have a much better chance of succeeding in life. Ultimately, a positive attitude can make a huge difference in how successful one is not only in their career but in life overall.',\n",
       " '\"When you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate\\'s electors.\"\\n\\nThis shouldn\\'t be the way candidates win. The election should change, the candidates should earn their votes, win by popular vote.\\n\\nIf the process of voting changes to \"win by popular votes\" then at least the candidate would win fairly. If you think about it, wouldn\\'t you want to win fair and square? don\\'t you think you should earn your votes? or in general, if you think people should earn their votes then you should get an understanding of what is trying to be explained here.\\n\\nI\\'m not the only one that thinks that the election should be by popular vote;\\n\\n\"over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\"\\n\\nplenty of other people think we should vote directly instead of having the Electoral College system.\\n\\nNobody wants to vote for other people other than the one running for President, well at least 60 percent of the people don\\'t.\\n\\nThe electoral college is unfair and it is why I think the election should count by popular vote. The electoral college is unfair because sometimes candidates don\\'t a have chance to visit states so it\\'s difficult to gain votes from those states the people who vote aren\\'t really voting, it\\'s the electors who are a large state gets more attention from presidental candidates in a campaign than a small state does (basically what I meant in reason 1)\\n\\nThe point here is, I think we should get rid of the Electoral College since it has been proven that it is unfair and just have a fair voting system from now on.

       " '[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP Code]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Date]\\n\\n[Senator\\'s Name]\\n[Senator\\'s Address]\\n[City, State, ZIP Code]\\n\\nDear [Senator\\'s Name],\\n\\nI am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College system and to argue in favor of keeping it, as opposed to changing to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. After carefully considering the information presented in various texts, including \"What Is the Electoral College?\" by the Office of the Federal Register, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\" by Bradford Plumer, and \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\" by Judge Richard A. Posner, I believe that the Electoral College remains the most effective and beneficial method of electing our nation\\'s leader.\\n\\nOne of the key reasons to retain the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome, as stated by Judge Richard A. Posner in his article. In the Electoral College system, the winning candidate\\'s share of the electoral vote tends to exceed their share of the popular vote, creating a clear and decisive outcome. This reduces the likelihood of disputes over the election results, unlike what may occur in a direct popular vote system.\\n\\nMoreover, the Electoral College ensures that the President has trans-regional appeal, as mentioned by Judge Posner. With no region having enough electoral votes to elect a President, candidates are incentivized to appeal to a broad range of voters across different regions. This helps to prevent the election of a candidate with only regional support, promoting national unity and representation for all citizens.\\n\\nThe existence of swing states is another significant advantage of the Electoral College system, as explained by Judge Posner. By focusing campaign efforts on toss-up states, candidates are compelled to pay closer attention to the concerns, interests, and needs of these states and their constituents. This leads to a more informed and thoughtful electorate, as swing state voters play a pivotal role in deciding the outcome of the election.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College ensures that large states are not overlooked, as highlighted by Judge Posner. In a campaign, presidential candidates give more attention to states with larger populations due to the number of electoral votes at stake. This balances the political influence of large states, counteracting the mal-apportionment of power caused by the Senate\\'s constitutional mandate for equal representation of each state.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections, as mentioned by Judge Posner. By requiring a candidate to win a majority of electoral votes to secure the presidency, the system avoids the complications and costs associated with subsequent run-off elections. Instead, it ensures a clear winner, promoting stability and efficiency in the election process.\\n\\nWhile some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states considered \"safe\" for a particular party, it is important to emphasize that voters are motivated by their desire to express a political preference, as mentioned in Judge Posner\\'s article. The knowledge that their vote may not directly impact the election\\'s outcome does not prevent individuals from participating in the democratic process and exercising their right to vote.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College remains a crucial institution that upholds the principles of our Constitution and supports our democratic system. Its preservation ensures a fair and representative election process, while promoting national unity, thoughtful campaigning, and the importance of every region\\'s voice. For these reasons, I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College and reject any proposals to change to a popular vote system.\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this important matter. I trust that you will consider my perspective and weigh it alongside the views of others to make an informed decision that best serves our nation\\'s interests. I appreciate your dedication and service to our state and our country.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]',\n",

Having so much pollution can kill our planet.\\n\\nMany people around the world want to help our planet. Driving cars is easier but it is very bad for our plants and trees and for our own health. People in Colombia as said in source 3 are getting together and making this happened because they see th actual change behind all this. Some people might think this idea is crazy but it actual can work. We have over a billion cars driving around our Earth and all of that goes up to the air and we breath all of that and that makes our day look ugly and the Earth not look so pretty. Flowers have been growing faster after this idea was made natural air gives us strength.\\n\\nIn 2013 as said in source 4 they have investigated that Americans are driving less and getting less licenses. Driving less cars makes us live longer because we are not just sitting their in a car doing nothing we are actuve riding a bike or even walking. For those ong trips that take ours to get their we call a bus or a taxi and pay them to get their that is less cars and vehicles that are driving around hurting out planet. It is much better to have the world like this because you will see the population growing and people living longer and not passing away at an early age. Like this we dont breath that nasty air that cars let out and little kids dont have to breath it either like that when they grow up they will be strong and healthy.\\n\\nA lot of people might think taht this idea is crazy but when they actual try it out they will start realizing how it well help our planet very much. When was th elast time you went out walking and then a car passes by you and all that gas air gets in your face? all of that air is very annoying and it gets you out of air right? well that is why its best to just walk everyone and if your really that lazy just call a taxi our a bus to pick you up.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0       \\xa0       \\xa0    ',\n",

One where no cell phones at all another where students can use it during lunch and free time. I am writing to you because I would agree with the policy where they can use it during lunch and free time.\\n\\nI believe students should use cell phones during lunch and free time because they tend to sneak using their cell phones in class. If they know they look at it or text someone later then they won't need to use their phone and that would eliminate the distraction of the cell phone in class. When it comes to not handing things in, the students could just call or text their parents in between classes and therefore by handing the assignment in on time the students grades would improve. Even if something comes up and their parents are at work and they need to let them know their not staying after school then they should be able to tell them. What if someone forgot he/ she was having a friend over and needed to be picked up. Now they could just call instead of at the end of the day and have to wait for ten minutes while they waited for the parents pick them up.\\n\\nWhen you can't use cell phones assignments are handed in late due to the fact they'll be left at home. Students will sneak using their phones in class and by doing that they will either get caught and get in trouble or be distracted in class. Also students could be waiting long after school because their parents could forget to pick them up or will not be notified to.\\n\\nI hope you take these factors into consideration when making your decision. Thank you for reading this.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nYour 8th grade student\",\n",
       " 'Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. The passage set provides several examples of the positive impacts of reducing car dependence, such as improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and a shift towards more sustainable and inclusive transportation systems.\\n\\nOne of the key benefits of limiting car usage is the positive impact on the environment. The passages highlight the substantial role that cars play in greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of these emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, the figure can reach up to 50%. This is a significant contribution to climate change and air pollution. By reducing car usage, we can decrease carbon emissions and improve air quality, creating a healthier environment for everyone.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limited car usage is the promotion of alternative transportation modes. The passage set showcases examples from different countries, such as the car-free day in Bogota and the transformation of suburbs in Germany to be more accessible to public transportation. These initiatives encourage the use of buses, bikes, and walking, which are more sustainable and can help to reduce traffic congestion. By providing better infrastructure and incentives for using these modes of transport, we can create more efficient and accessible urban environments.\\n\\nAdditionally, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passage about Paris banning driving due to smog mentions that congestion decreased by 60%. This implies that reducing car usage can improve traffic flow and decrease commuting times, leading to increased productivity and economic efficiency. Furthermore, there can be cost savings for individuals who rely less on cars. The passage about Vauban, Germany, mentions that 70% of families in the community do not own cars, and 57% sold a car to move there. This suggests that households can save money by not having to maintain and fuel cars, and instead use more cost-effective transportation options.\\n\\nWhile there may be concerns about the impact of limiting car usage on personal mobility and convenience, the passage set suggests that these challenges can be mitigated. The introduction of car-sharing programs and the development of better public transportation systems provide viable alternatives to car ownership. Additionally, advancements in technology, such as carpooling apps and bike-sharing programs, make these alternative modes of transportation more accessible and convenient.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, ranging from environmental benefits and reduced greenhouse gas emissions to improved traffic flow and economic efficiency. By promoting alternative transportation modes and investing in sustainable infrastructure, we can create more livable and environmentally friendly communities.',\n",

While some may argue that it is not a viable option, I believe that it offers many benefits for students who may not be able to attend traditional classes due to various reasons.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of distance learning is that it allows students to attend classes from the comfort of their own homes. This can be especially beneficial for students who may have difficulty attending classes due to physical or mental health issues. By allowing students to attend classes from home, they can focus on their studies without the distractions of the classroom environment.\\n\\nAdditionally, distance learning can be a great option for students who may not be able to attend classes due to financial or logistical reasons. For example, students who may not have access to transportation or who may not be able to afford the cost of attending traditional classes can still take advantage of distance learning options.\\n\\nAnother advantage of distance learning is that it can be more flexible than traditional classes. Students can attend classes at their own pace and on their own schedule, which can be especially beneficial for students who may have other commitments, such as work or family responsibilities.\\n\\nHowever, some may argue that distance learning is not as effective as traditional classes. They may argue that students may not be as motivated to attend classes if they are not physically present in the classroom. While this may be true for some students, I believe that students who are committed to their studies can still be just as effective in distance learning as they would be in traditional classes.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe that distance learning offers many benefits for students who may not be able to attend traditional classes due to various reasons.

       " \"Hey there!  So, for this essay, I'm gonna talk about how people can positively influence their lives and others. \\n\\nFirst off, let's talk about making smart decisions.  When we make smart decisions, we're not just thinking about ourselves, but also about how they'll affect others. Like, if we decide to study hard for a test, we're not just doing it for ourselves, but also for our friends who might be relying on us to help them out. And if we make good choices, we can set a good example for others to follow.  It's like, if we're responsible and make good decisions, others might be more likely to do the same.\\n\\nAnother way people can influence their lives is by having friends with similar interests.  I mean, think about it, when we're surrounded by people who like the same things as us, it's way easier to stay motivated and excited about life. Like, if I'm hanging out with friends who are into photography, I'm more likely to pick up my camera and take some cool pics. And if we support each other, we can all become better at what we love. \\n\\nLastly, setting a good example for others is super important.  When we do well in school, exercise regularly, or just generally be a good person, it can inspire others to do the same. Like, if my little sister sees me studying hard, she might be more likely to do the same. And if we show others that we can achieve our goals, they might feel more confident about their own. \\n\\nSo, in conclusion,  people can positively influence their lives and others by making smart decisions, having friends with similar interests, and setting a good example. By doing these things, we can help each other reach our full potential and achieve our goals.  And who knows, maybe one day we'll be inspiring others to do the same!

       " \"Libraries have been around for centuries, providing people with access to books and other sources of information. However, with the advent of the digital age, the role of libraries has come under scrutiny. Some argue that with the internet and digital technology, libraries are no longer necessary. I disagree. Libraries are just as important today as they have ever been.\\n\\nFirstly, libraries provide a quiet, peaceful environment for people to study and research. This is especially crucial for students who may not have access to a computer or the internet at home. Libraries also offer a vast array of books, journals, and other resources that are not available online. This is particularly important for researchers who need access to primary sources and other specialized materials.\\n\\nAnother important role that libraries play is in promoting literacy and a love of reading. Libraries offer a wide range of books and other materials that cater to different age groups and interests. This encourages people to read and explore new ideas, which is essential for personal and intellectual growth. Additionally, libraries often host events and activities that promote literacy and a love of reading, such as author talks, book clubs, and story time for children.\\n\\nFurthermore, libraries provide a community space where people can come together and learn from each other. Libraries often host workshops, seminars, and other educational events that are free and open to the public. This helps to foster a sense of community and promotes lifelong learning. Libraries also often provide access to technology and digital resources, such as computers, printers, and scanners, which are essential for people who may not have access to these resources at home.\\n\\nFinally, libraries are an important part of preserving our cultural heritage. They collect, catalog, and preserve books, documents, and other materials that are important to our history and culture. This is crucial for future generations, who will be able to learn about and appreciate our past.\\n\\nIn conclusion, libraries are just as important in the digital age as they have ever been. They provide a quiet environment for study and research, promote literacy and a love of reading, offer community space for learning and collaboration, and preserve our cultural heritage. While the internet and digital technology have certainly changed the way we access information, they have not made libraries obsolete. In fact, libraries have adapted to the digital age by offering e-books, digital resources, and online databases. Therefore, it is important that we continue to support and fund libraries, so that they can continue to play their vital role in our communities.\\n\\nPlease grade this essay and provide feedback.\\n\\nGrade: _____________\\n\\nFeedback:\\n\\nStrengths:\\n\\n* The essay presents a clear and well-supported argument in favour of the continued importance of libraries in the digital age.\\n* The writer provides several convincing reasons why libraries are still necessary, including their role in promoting literacy, providing a quiet study environment, and preserving cultural heritage.\\n* The essay is well-organized and easy to follow, with each paragraph focusing on a different aspect of the role of libraries.\\n\\nWeaknesses:\\n\\n* The essay could benefit from more specific examples and evidence to support the writer's arguments. For example, the writer could provide statistics or anecdotes to illustrate the importance of libraries for students who do not have access to computers or the internet at home.\\n* Some of the sentences are awkwardly phrased or contain grammatical errors, which detracts from the overall quality of the essay.\\n* The conclusion could be stronger. Instead of simply summarizing the main points, the writer could end with a more thought-provoking or insightful comment on the significance of libraries in the digital age.\\n\\nSuggestions for Improvement:\\n\\n* Provide more specific examples and evidence to support the writer's arguments.\\n* Edit the essay for clarity and grammar.\\n* Develop a stronger conclusion that leaves the reader with a lasting impression.\\n\\nGrade: B+\",\n",
       " \"Dear TEACHER_NAME,\\n\\nI have heard that you're reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. This maybe my opinion but I think many other children agree. I think you should accept policy number one. Cell phones are a very important part of the new world that we live in today. Cell phones should be allowed because they can be used to call for emergencies, parents feel more secure if they can contact their children anytime, and because not everyone has friends that are particularly in the school that they're in.\\n\\nTo start off, cell phones are one of the most important things to have if you're in an emergency. It's very uncommon to be in an emergency at school ,but I would prefer to have my cell phone just incase. We can have bus accidents, be in a fight , leave your house keys at home, need new clothes if you uhh... have an accident. There are all sorts of reasons! Expect the unexpected is what they might say. Emergencies are a very common reason; I know. The reason why it's usually repeated is because it's important! As principal, you must always think of the children's safety.\\n\\nContinuing, parents feel a lot more secure if they can talk to their children anytime. If you have a daughter or son, you should know the feeling. Parents always ask their children to bring their cell phones with them when they're out with friends, at a relative's house, or even at home! They want to know that you're safe everywhere you go. It's a parent thing, I suppose. Also, cell phones have a contact book that saves everyone's phone number that's registered. You can't believe how many people I know that don't even know their parent's or house number! I read in a book that there has been an accident in South America that made parents uproar about cell phones in school. Now that wouldn't be pleasant, now would it?\\n\\nFinally, not everyone has friends that they can see in school. They can even be in different periods than them. As a teenager, we always worry about our social life as well as academics. I have often heard from kids that they love going to school just for their friends. Some people aren't part of the 'in crowd'. The people who are, however , can talk all they want if it's during free time. I don't see any harm in that. There's no class disruptions which is a main reason why cell phones are ofte\",\n",

In this essay, I will discuss the positive effects of technology on people's lives, provide examples of how technology makes people's daily tasks easier, discuss how technology can help those in difficult situations, examine how technology allows students to complete daily tasks without direct contact with other people, and explore how technology can help students in their schooling.\\n\\nOne of the most significant positive effects of technology on people's lives is the way it makes daily tasks easier. For example, technology has made it possible for people to shop online, which saves time and money. Additionally, technology has made it possible for people to communicate with others easily, regardless of where they are in the world. This has made it easier for people to maintain relationships with friends and family members who live far away.\\n\\nAnother way that technology has had a positive impact on people's lives is by helping those in difficult situations. For example, technology has made it possible for people to access medical care remotely, which can be especially helpful for those who live in rural areas or have limited mobility. Additionally, technology has made it possible for people to receive mental health support through online therapy and other digital resources.\\n\\nTechnology has also had a significant impact on education. For example, technology has made it possible for students to access educational resources and complete assignments online. This can be especially helpful for students who have busy schedules or who live in areas with limited educational resources. Additionally, technology has made it possible for students to collaborate on projects with others, regardless of where they are in the world.\\n\\nFinally, technology has allowed people to complete daily tasks without direct contact with other people. For example, people can use technology to shop online, pay bills, and complete other tasks without ever leaving their homes.

       " 'Agreeing to the developments of smart cars has it\\'s advantages but it also has it\\'s disadvantages. Some smart cars can be developed to not have the need for a human to be responsible at anytime. Others disagree with the idea and think this idea should stop. In my opinion I disagree with the development in smart cars.\\n\\nThe inventors of these smart cars say that they have sensors to know if the human is paying attention but having smarter cars for that reason can be dangerous. Many people have had accidents and many of those accidents have been fatal. All those accidents need is for the person to take his/her eyes off the road for a quick second. At this moment they have cars that can drive themsleves but also need assitance once in a while but anyone can say \"Oh I\\'ve got my eyes on the road\" but in reality they are more distracted than a child playing toys. Many people can trust a car at it\\'s job for one second but lose their life the next. Smart car development is not the smart way to go.\\n\\nIf furtists develop a car that can do its job with no human assistance at all, of course people will start buying but I guarantee more accidents occur. These car companies can\\'t guarantee you that the car may turn off, that the car will stop working out of no where. Anyone can be driving and thinking the car has everything under control they start putting their mind into other things like texting, calling, writing, and even changing in a car because they\\'re late to their destination. You can\\'t always trust technology because there is something that can always make it go wrong. People will be unaware of everything going on around them when their eyes, ears, and mind aren\\'t neccesary on the road. When the time comes on who\\'s fault it was that the accident occured the question will be whose fault was it really the manufacturer orr the drivers? If you would\\'ve kept your eyes on the road and tooken responsibilty you\\'d be able to prevent being in a room where your freedom is to determined all because of one \"smart car.\"',\n",
       " \"Positive Attitudes\\n\\nAs an eighth-grade student, I have learned that having a positive attitude can have a significant impact on a person's success, happiness, and acceptance within a community. In my research, I have discovered that personal experiences and life lessons can contribute to one's attitude, and people with positive attitudes can serve as role models in a community. Furthermore, positivity can help one realize their potential and achieve success.\\n\\nFirstly, having a positive attitude can lead to greater success in various aspects of life. Studies have shown that people with positive attitudes tend to be more motivated, focused, and productive than those with negative attitudes. This can translate into better academic performance, increased job satisfaction, and improved relationships with others. For example, when faced with challenges, people with positive attitudes are more likely to view them as opportunities for growth and learning, rather than obstacles to be overcome. This mindset can lead to greater creativity, innovation, and problem-solving skills.\\n\\nSecondly, personal experiences and life lessons can shape a person's attitude. Positive experiences, such as achieving a goal or receiving recognition for a job well done, can reinforce a positive attitude and increase self-esteem. Conversely, negative experiences, such as failure or rejection, can lead to a more negative attitude and decrease self-confidence. Additionally, life lessons, such as learning from mistakes and learning to persevere through adversity, can help individuals develop a more positive attitude and resilience.\\n\\nThirdly, people with positive attitudes can serve as role models in a community. They can inspire others to adopt a more positive attitude and encourage them to pursue their goals and dreams. Role models can also provide guidance and support to those who may be struggling with negative emotions or experiences. By modeling positive behaviors and attitudes, role models can help to create a more positive and supportive community.\\n\\nFourthly, positivity can help individuals realize their potential and achieve success. When people have a positive attitude, they are more likely to believe in themselves and their abilities. This can lead to greater self-confidence, which can in turn lead to greater motivation and effort towards achieving their goals. Additionally, positivity can help individuals overcome self-doubt and fear, which can hold them back from pursuing their full potential.\\n\\nFinally, it is important to encourage and acknowledge people with positive attitudes.

       " 'I believe that we should transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. This is because renewable energy is better for the environment and it will not run out, unlike fossil fuels.\\n\\nFirstly, renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power do not release harmful pollutants into the air, unlike fossil fuels which release carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to climate change. This means that using renewable energy is better for the environment and helps to keep our air clean.\\n\\nSecondly, renewable energy sources are sustainable because they do not run out. Fossil fuels, on the other hand, are finite resources that will eventually run out. By transitioning to renewable energy, we can ensure that we have a reliable source of energy for the future.\\n\\nFurthermore, renewable energy sources are becoming more affordable and efficient. For example, the cost of solar panels has decreased significantly in recent years, making them more accessible to homeowners and businesses. As technology improves, renewable energy sources will become even more efficient and cost-effective.\\n\\nIn conclusion, transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources is the right thing to do for the environment and for future generations. It will help to reduce pollution, ensure a sustainable energy supply, and save money in the long run.',\n",
       " 'The automobile has been a staple in human history ever since it was first created, they have been used by people wether it was grocery shopping or during war. These days limiting car use has more advantages than ever. Such advantages are that it helps reduce the amount of pollution to the environment, helps people save money, swell as it helps people become more sociable and less stressed.\\n\\nThe limiting of car usage has many advantages one would be that it helps to reduce pollution caused by fuel emissions. Using vehicles creates green house emissions which cause the Earth to become hotter and then global warming becomes a big problem. According to the article \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive area in the United States. So limiting car usage reduces the amount of emissions produced greatly. Smog is also a great threat to the environment, smog is created just like fog except polluted air gets into the mix of warm days and cold nights. Then instead of getting fog there is smog a more dense unhealthy version of fog. Paris has had a rough time when it came to smog which according to \"Paris bans driving due to smog\" by Robert Duffer resulted from the fact that \"Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France.\\n\\nSaving money is a big plus to the restriction on car use. With more buildings and shopping centers being built closer to suburban area makes walking a good way to save money. Andrew Selsky author of the article \"carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\" made a comment on the situation in Bogota saying \"parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up\". With more shopping centers for people to be able to reach by foot, bike, carpool, or bus can greatly reduce the amount people spend on gas and car repairs.\\n\\nLimiting the usage of cars also in a strange way helps people become more connected with each other. Limiting car use will alow people to hang out more in things such as carpooling, bike rides, walking, public transportation. Allowing for people to meet more people. Also it wil allow people to use things such as social media to stil feel connected to their freinds without having to drive out to meet them. In another article by Elisabeth Rosenthal \"The End of Car Culture\" Rosenthal interviewed professor Mimi Sheller Who stated \"the rise iin cellphones and carpooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arranments,includiong the evolution of shared van services for getting to work. The restriction on car usage allows for people to meet new people through the carpool service and such things.\\n\\nA limitaion on car usage would have so many advntages to people and the environment. It helps reduce the amount of pollution from fuel and carbon emissions, helps people save money and not need a car to get to a store or park, and have people become more connected to each other.',\n",
       " \"Most students wouldn't want a project over a break out of school. Over break students will wanna juust chill and be a kid but also you have to keep your grades on point. Some students are not gonna do the project over break cause I mean it's a break out of school, but if the project is required and some students need to bring up their grade then they should do it to get that grade up because projects are a big factor in classes for students. Its an oppertunity to get your grade back up or it could just be practice for you. Students should be able to choose what kind of project they want to do, the projects teachers give students are boring sometimes, some students want to get creative and do their own project and teachers can ee how creative some of their student can get when they have that oppertunity to do it. Teachers normally give out projects for when the class is doing a certain unit like in science they have units like; Volcanoes, Atmosphere, Genes, and migration. Teachers would give students projets like that and would make students stress over the project, if teachers let students take control of what kind of project their doing the class probably would be allot better and enthusiastic when it gets presented or when they get another project. Some students hate doing projects thats why some students grades be so low from when the project is due they would not turn the project in and their grade would drop serverly an dthe teacher will not let that student make up the project, yea some teachers are like that. Teachers give students projects for a reason to make sure they know the material and the concept of the lesson, some students might find the project hard so the teacher would put students in either groups of 2 or 4 at the most. Other subjects would guve students projects to like; History, Goverment, Tech Ed, Language arts, i've never seen a math teacher give students a project for math. If students have the right to choose their own kind of project that wuld make projects on students so much easier and it proably won't take as much time as normal projects do. Depending on the subject depends on how students react to the project teachers don't understand how much stress they put on students when they give students projects, students stress because they have allot of other work to do besides that project and that will push students behind and make their grade drop because of how far behind they got because that project. The projects teachers give students seem way more difficult because if students had their way with the project students would get it out the way and it wouln't even stress the out that much and it would put them in a better place to their other work snd keep their head focused. Student athletes go through it when they get a bunch of homework and then the teacher gives a project right after, then student athletes don't get home until about 7 or 8 at night and they either would be to tired to do it or would be up all night doing the work and the project on top of that so student athletes get it the worse out of any other students, because they have so much to do and some of them won't have the time to cathc up on it some students will skip practice to catch up on school work because of the amounts of school work students get. Certain projects be easy for students like, Language arts projects are easy most History projects are easy to but teahcers find a way to make them difficult. Some teachers make students do projects over break ad some students say no im not doing the project and their grade reflects that so if you get a project over a break of school make sure you do it so your grade doesn't drop and it keeps you mentally ready for when you gotta go back to school and learn new stuff but the same stuff you heard before you left for break. When teachers give students projects over break I feel like somme teachers do it on purpose but some teachers do it to keep their students in track outside of school but their is a problem with all students when they get their project over break. Studets wouldn't start it untill like 2 days before they go back to school so students woul e rushing tring to get their project to look nice and in the mean while the stidents that already started the project are most likely finish with the project so when they get back to school is go to their teacher turn the project in and make sure they have everything the need for the project to e prepped and finished at school if needed thats why you shoudl do your project's when yoy get the at school.\",\n",
       " 'Groups can be great for getting work done faster and learning new things. Working with a group gives people the opportunity to find help and support from others, whereas working alone can often be overwhelming and difficult. One of the benefits of working with a group is that it can reduce the pressure that individuals in the group may feel, as it is easier to divide the tasks and responsibilities between the members. \\n\\nGroups can also help with grades and learning new things since people can typically learn from one another more easily in a group setting. In order for groups to maximize their productivity, teachers need to structure groups in ways that are most effective for the students. For example, teams may benefit from having a clear leader and consistent goals. Teachers can also assign certain tasks to certain individuals to ensure the team is on track and working in a collaborative way.',\n",
       " ' Aesop\\'s famous saying, \"No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted,\" highlights the importance of small gestures of kindness. Kindness can take many forms, from opening a door to giving compliments to helping someone with their bags. These small acts can have a significant impact on others, even saving lives.\\n\\nFor example, a simple act of kindness such as asking someone how their day is going can make a huge difference in their life. It shows that you care about them and are willing to listen. This can be especially important for someone who is going through a difficult time and may feel isolated or alone. By reaching out and offering a listening ear, you can help them feel supported and valued.\\n\\nAnother way that small acts of kindness can make a difference is by encouraging others to do good things for others. When someone receives help, they may feel grateful and inspired to pay it forward. For example, if you help someone with their bags, they may feel grateful and may later offer to help someone else. This can create a chain reaction of kindness, where one small act can inspire others to do the same.\\n\\nUltimately, the importance of small acts of kindness cannot be overstated. They can have a ripple effect that can change the world. By making a small act of kindness today, you can inspire others to do the same and create a brighter future for everyone.',\n",
       " ' The rise of remote learning has led to a debate on whether students would benefit from attending classes from home or not. While some argue that students can do well working from home, others argue that attending classes from school is better. In this essay, we will explore both arguments and determine which option is better for students.\\n\\nOn the one hand, students can do well working from home. With the rise of technology, students can attend classes from the comfort of their own home through online platforms. This option is particularly beneficial for students who have busy schedules or who live far from the school. Additionally, students can work at their own pace, which can be helpful for those who need more time to understand the material.\\n\\nOn the other hand, attending classes from school is better for students. While students can work at their own pace when studying from home, they often lack the guidance and support of a teacher. Teachers can provide students with additional help and support when they are struggling with a particular concept. Additionally, attending classes from school provides students with the opportunity to interact with their peers and collaborate on projects.\\n\\nFurthermore, students who attend classes from school are less likely to cheat on exams and assignments. When students are working from home, they have access to the internet, which can make it easy to cheat on exams and assignments. In contrast, attending classes from school provides students with a controlled environment, where cheating is less likely to occur.\\n\\nIn conclusion, both options have their pros and cons. While students can do well working from home, attending classes from school provides students with the guidance and support of a teacher, as well as the opportunity to interact with their peers. Additionally, attending classes from school provides students with a controlled environment, where cheating is less likely to occur. Ultimately, the best option for students depends on their individual needs and circumstances.',\n",

We use the second policy now\\n\\n(except were allowed to bring our phones as long as their turned off), but most of the kids here use their backpacks as cover of put up their books to sneak- a -peek at their texts.\\n\\nMost children think at this age that talking to their friends is more productive than listening to the boring teacher that is droning on and on about something.

I know it is hard to get things that students like but I\\'m just guessing that there would be less phones out in the classroom if things were different and if the students were not the students here at the school.

       " 'Cars have undergone many changes since they were first established. Since then what is reffered to by \"smog\" has severly incresed. \"Smog\" is also what is called greenhouse gas emissions. Over the years many countries have undergone ways to prevent car usage in effect to gradually reduce \"smog\"\\n\\nIn Vauban Germany, many people dont use cars due to the fact that street parking, driveways, and even home garages are tipiclly forbidden. Some benifits are, less stress, ruduced greenhouse gas emissions, closer shopping areas and stores in walking distance. In Paris, peoples driving rights on Mondays as well as Tuesdays are being revoked by the number on the license plate. All this in effort to reduce smog. Failing to abide the rules of revoked driving led to a fine which many people recieved, then giving up cars. In Bogota Columbia, theres a program meant to reduce the \"smog\" as well. This being called \"Day without cars\". Violations to follow the day without cars also resulted to a fine.\\n\\nIn the United States of America people have seemed to loose interest in cars and license at that matter. The peak of miles driven was in the year of 2005, decreasing after that, our percentage rate was 9 percent below the peak of 2005 and equal to the time period of January 1995. The decrease has been assumed to be because of the recession. Since the amount of miles has decresed, and because the recession people have not been as interested with driving beause how much gasoline has costed. With amount of miles drivien in America decresed, in Columbia, the a amount of bicycle paths had increased to 118+ miles.\\n\\nCars are on of the biggest greenhouse gas emission producers, in France, Diesel fuel was blamed because it was a favored from a tax policy. Paris tipically has the most smog due to the increased use of diesel fuel. Paris\\' amount of smog was 147 micrograms of particulate matter compared to a low of 79.7 micrograms of particulate matter in London. Usages of cars are going down all over the world. therefore reducing the amount of smog greatly.\\n\\nThe way many countries have new and improved ways to reduce the amount of smog is incredible. Cars are now being used less, biking, hiking, walking, and bussing is now easier to do with what is happened. Car companies have come to advertising cars they wouldnt usually advertise, becuase they are not selling as many cars and they are trying to appeal to everyone. It has been said with driving less it relieves stress, and has been scientifically proven to ruduce the amount of smog. Many people are interested and cars and getting their license, but it just has not been a priority. There are many advantages to limiting car usage.    ',\n",
       " 'Limiting car usage would bring a ridiculous amount of advantages, even happiness as stated by Heidrun Walter who is briefly mentioned in the first article titled \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\". Automobiles such as cars, planes, even ships, are responsible for a whole lot of greenhouse gas emissions, about 12 percent in all of Europe and up to 50 in areas of the United States where the use of cars is excessive. Vauban is an upscale community where the majority of people have given up their cars. In the United States there have been agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency have been promoting for more car reduced communities just like Vauban. Unfortunately according to this same article and word by David Goldburg states, \"experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill\" apparently the bill is to be approved of this year. In previous bills 80 percent of appropritions have by law gone to highways, only 20 percent has gone to actual transport. As any normal person knows, construction work causes a whole lot of polution.\\n\\nIn the second article I used titiled \"Paris bans driving due to smog\" Paris (the city) had no choice but to enforce a partial driving ban due to the fact that there was so much smog. The smog was so intense that it even rivaled Beijing, China, which is definitely one of the most polluted cities in the world. Those with even-numbered license plates were required to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine (about $31). This nasty smog lasted about five long days, but at least public transit was free. The French blamed Diesel fuel for the pollution since 67% of the vehicles on France run on diesel due to a tax policy. The third article I used is called \"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\". Bogota is located in Colombia and for three straight years cars have been banned for the Day Without Cars (excluding buses and taxis). Those who violate this day face $25 fines. Not even the occasional gray clouds and rain has stopped people from participating, after all umbrellas do exist. Do to this parks and sports centers bloomed throughout the city, rush-hour restrictions had gotten rid of a whole lot of traffic, new shopping districts and restaurants have popped up, It\\'s amazing how vehicles, or none at all, can affect lives.\\n\\nThe fourth and last article is called \"The End Of Car Culture\". According to the article, \"studies claim that Americans are buying less cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each yeah goes by.\" according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, which is an investment research company, the number of miles driven in America had reached it\\'s peak in 2005 but slowly has gone down. We Americans drive as much as we did in 1995 which would be amazing if the reason for this would not be the recession causing less people to afford cars. If we do change for the better and own less vehicles then unfortunately companies like Honda, Mustang, etc, will most likely have to go out of business; it\\'s unfortunate for them at least. Companies like Ford and Mercedes now have a wider range of products besides personal vehicles. There\\'s also been a large drop in the percentage of people who decide to get a license between the ages of 16 to 39 according to a research study by Micheal Sivak. A study last year found that the amount of yound people driving also decresed 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.\\n\\nEven people like Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company laid out a business plan for a world where personal vehicle ownership is impractical or even undesirable. He\\'d even work with the telecommunications industry to make cities where \"pedestrian, bicycle, privated cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.\" I love how he mentions that this will improve safety and almost none of the other articles do, they mostly mention getting rid of pollution (which is also always great). In a place like Miami, where I live, there are a whole lot of reckless drivers, getting rid of some cars would do an exciting place like this a whole lot of good to the community. I know myself that cutting down on vehicles seems like a very hard job to do, and it is, but check out all of these benefits human lives will get. People would argue that an idea like this is ridiculous, and at first it might sound like it, but the moment you realize we aren\\'t getting rid of all vehicles everywhere things start getting easier for you to understand.

Volcanoes are caused by the intense heat within the Earth's mantle, which is pushed up towards the surface due to an increase in pressure, resulting in molten rock erupting. Such violent eruptions can have a devastating effect on people and the environment, with lava flows consuming homes, structures and in some cases entire villages. Volcanoes are typically composed of an outer shell of solid material that has been explosively ejected around the opening, followed by the inner layers of rock and lava. \\n\\nDespite these dangers, a volcano can be an enjoyable educational activity to explore and appreciate their raw power.

But should drivers be allowed to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle? In my opinion, the answer is no.\\n\\nFirst of all, using a cell phone while driving is a major distraction. When you're driving, your focus should be on the road and the other cars around you. But when you're texting or talking on the phone, your attention is divided. You're not paying as much attention to the road, which means you're more likely to get into an accident.\\n\\nAccording to some statistics, texting and driving is actually more dangerous than drunk driving! That's because when you're texting, you're taking your eyes off the road for longer periods of time. And even if you're just talking on the phone, you're still not paying as much attention to your surroundings as you should be.\\n\\nAnother reason why drivers should not use cell phones while driving is that it's not fair to other drivers. Imagine you're driving down the road and suddenly a car swerves into your lane because the driver is texting. That could be really scary! It's not right to put other people's lives at risk just because you want to check your phone.\\n\\nSome people might argue that cell phones can be useful in emergencies. For example, if you're in an accident, you might need to call for help. But that's not a good enough reason to allow cell phone use while driving. If you're in an emergency situation, you should pull over to a safe place and then call for help.\\n\\nIn conclusion, using cell phones while driving is a dangerous and unfair practice. Drivers should not be allowed to use their cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. It's better to be safe than sorry, and our roads will be much safer if we all put our phones away while driving.\",\n",

While there are many benefits to these programs, there are also some potential drawbacks that must be considered. In this essay, we will explore the advantages and disadvantages of peer mentoring programs in schools, and discuss how they could be beneficial for students in increasing academic achievement.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of peer mentoring programs is that they provide students with a supportive network of peers who can help them navigate the challenges of school. Older students, who have already gone through the same experiences, can offer guidance and advice to younger students who may be struggling with social adjustment or understanding new classes. This can be particularly helpful for students who are new to a school or community, as they may feel overwhelmed by the new environment and lack of familiarity with their peers.\\n\\nIn addition to providing social support, peer mentoring programs can also help students build study habits and improve academic achievement. By working together, students can learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses, and develop strategies for studying and completing assignments. This can be particularly helpful for students who may struggle with time management or organization, as they can learn from their peers who have already mastered these skills.\\n\\nDespite the many benefits of peer mentoring programs, there are also some potential drawbacks that must be considered. One of the main concerns is that these programs may not be effective for all students. Some students may be resistant to working with peers or may not feel comfortable asking for help from others. In addition, there may be a lack of trained mentors available to lead these programs, which could lead to ineffective or inadequate support for students.\\n\\nAnother potential disadvantage of peer mentoring programs is that they may create a sense of competition or pressure among students. If students feel that they are being judged or compared to their peers, they may become more focused on achieving high grades or accolades, rather than on learning and personal growth. This could lead to a narrow focus on academic achievement, and a neglect of other important aspects of development, such as social skills and emotional well-being.\\n\\nIn conclusion, peer mentoring programs have\",\n",
       " '\"I read an interesting article about technology called the Facial Action Coding System that can identify human emotions. It made me think about whether it would be valuable to use this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.\\n\\nOn one hand, it could be helpful for teachers to know how their students are feeling. Maybe a student is struggling with a topic and feeling frustrated, but they don\\'t want to speak up in front of the class. If the teacher could see that the student was feeling frustrated through this technology, they could offer extra help or support without making the student feel embarrassed.\\n\\nHowever, I also think it could be a bit invasive. What if a student is just having a bad day and doesn\\'t want everyone to know how they\\'re feeling? Or what if the technology isn\\'t perfect and misinterprets a student\\'s expression, leading to misunderstandings or even punishment for something they didn\\'t actually feel?\\n\\nOverall, I think it could be a useful tool, but it would need to be used carefully and with respect for students\\' privacy and emotions. Teachers would need to be trained on how to interpret the technology accurately and how to use it to support their students, rather than punish or embarrass them.\"',\n",
       " \"As an 8th grader, I think distance learning classes can have a pretty big impact on how important school is to us. For one thing, since we don't have to physically go to school, we can do our work whenever and wherever we want. This can be pretty cool, especially if we have a lot of other stuff to do at home, like sports or clubs or hanging out with friends. But it can also be kind of easy to take advantage of, like if we just want to skip a class and do something more fun instead.\\n\\nLike, I know some people who will just not do their work for a distance learning class because they don't have to be in a classroom and they don't have a teacher telling them what to do. They might just play video games or watch TV instead. And some people might even pretend to do their work, but they're really just messing around on their phone or something. It's like, why bother if you don't have to be there in person?\\n\\nBut even though it's easy to take advantage of, I think distance learning classes can also be kind of bad for our motivation and expectations. When we don't have to be in a classroom and see our friends and teachers every day, it can feel like school isn't as important. Like, why bother putting in effort if we don't have to be there? And if we're not putting in effort, then we're not going to learn as much and we're not going to do as well in school.\\n\\nAnd another thing is that without structure and supervision, some people might get into trouble or do things they're not supposed to do. Like, if there's no teacher there to make sure we're paying attention and following the rules, then some people might get distracted or start messing around. And that can be bad for our behavior and our grades.\\n\\nBut even though there are some downsides to distance learning classes, I think there are also some pros. For one thing, we can do our work whenever we want, so we can take breaks and do other things when we need to. And we can also learn at our own pace, so if we need more time to understand something, we can take it. And it's also really convenient, because we\",\n",

First, it'll give us more options to choose from, which means we can try new foods and maybe even find something we really like! 🤤 Some people might not like the food we already have, so this could be a good change for them.

       " 'Should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed?\\n\\nOn the first day of\\n\\nSummer Break one is thinking about all the things he\\'s going to be doing, like:relax all day, go on vacation, hang out with friends or family, play video games, and do non-school related things. Suddenly, he or she gets an email from their teacher saying,\"I hope everyone is enjoying summer so far, over the summer you will have to do a project on what you have learned this year.\" At the end of the email is the instructions the teacher says you have to do for your project. After reading the email one closes his laptop or turns off his phone with anger, because that one teacher ruined his summer.\\n\\nHow are people supposed to enjoy their summer break when a teacher gives them school-related stuff to do. Some teachers complain all the time about them having to grade all types of work when a student doesnt do his work. Teachers shouldn\\'t complain because,all they had to do is not give students any work especially over the summer. Then that will make the teachers job way much easier, because they won\\'t have much stuff to grade and worry about planning to do.\\n\\nSummer projects should be student-designed because, first of all student-designed projects, our more relaxful then teacher-designed projects. Student-designed projects would show more creativeness, and is more helpful. Second, they can show how much one has learned. While teacher-designed projects are much more stressful, one will have to do it rule,by rule, by rule, one little mess up can lower your score by a whole grade. On teacher- designed projects the teacher also won\\'t really tell who learned more, because they will all be very similar. Teacher-designed projects are also boring, because it\\'s better when you can use your own ideas instead of someone else ideas. Teachers most of the time always give the people with the most perfectly\\xa0organized project the best grade, when they dont even have good facts or anything about the project, while the people with not that good of organization but a lot of good information on the project get a lower grade.\\n\\nOne might ask, \"what is the reason for having a project during summer because that is when we have a break from school?\"\\n\\nThat\\'s just like saying,\"why do athletes like basketball players practice during off season?\" If a athlete does not practice during off season, they can probably lose their skill, be out of shape,and not get any better for the next season. Just like if we dont have any projects or work over the summer we can forget how to do certain stuff, and not be ready for the next school year. I still dont agree with the idea of projects during summer though because thats what fourth quarter projects should be about. It should be about what you learned over the school year, instead of having to waste time in the summer doing a project . If one still had to do a project over the summer it should also be optional extra credit for the next school year. One shouldn\\'t be forced to do school work over a time when you are supposed to be enjoying the summer off. One of my favorite sayings is from Allen Iverson when he said,\"Practice? Your\\'e talking bout practice? I am an All Star and you are talking about practice?\" That is what I would think about if a teacher emailed me during the summer and is talking to me about doing a project when i should be resting. What\\'s the point of summer if you are just going to be doing school work?   \\xa0 \\xa0',\n",

It is completely unfair to the voters, who most of the time feel as if they\\'re voicing their opinion for no reason since it doesn\\'t even get taken into consideration. The whole concept of the electoral college in it\\'s entirety is irrational.\\n\\nSome people want to be part of this country and participate in one of it\\'s biggest most known events, choosing the president but with the electoral college in our way like a stone wall preventing us from voicing our opinions makes it slightly impossible. Although I must state that the Electoral College does help avoid run-off elections according to source 3 by Richard A. Posner, parahgraph 22. This country is practically split into halves, meaning if two canidates won by popular vote but each had around the same percentage of votes the Electoral College would choose an obvious winner avoiding run-off elections and not complicating things further. That still doesn\\'t change the fact of how unfair it is to the voters.\\n\\n\"Abolish the electoral college!\" said by Bob Dole in source 2 by Bradford Plumer. Yes I agree, abolish it, tear it down to smithereans, bury it into the ground never to resurface again. The electoral college is like planning a family trip, the youngest sister wants to go to Ohio while her brother wants to go to California, they tell the oldest sister of these two location ideas and the sister goes off telling the mom to go to New York, completely ignoring the other two suggestions. In this scenario the two youngest children are the citizens while the oldest sister is the electoral college, thus making the electoral college irrational, injustice, and unfair. It can be argued that the electoral college does help in some aspects like the certainty of outcome described in source 3 by Richard A. Posner, paragraph 18. But some certainty doesn\\'t go a long way, there can be various faults in this certainty.\\n\\nIn my very argued opinion the electoral college is an outdated system usually old men like to stick to because they\\'re afraid of change.

       " 'As an eighth-grade student, I believe that it is better for school students to work from home rather than in school. While there are some benefits to working in school, such as access to resources and opportunities for socialization, the ease of access to resources and the amount of work that gets done are ultimately more important factors to consider.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of working from home is the ease of access to resources. When students are working from home, they have access to all of the resources they need to complete their work, including their computer, internet connection, and any textbooks or materials they need. This can be particularly helpful for students who may not have access to these resources at school, such as those who live in areas with limited internet access or who do not have their own computer.\\n\\nIn addition, working from home can help students to get more done in less time. Without the distractions of a busy school environment, students can focus more on their work and complete it more efficiently. This can be particularly beneficial for students who are struggling to keep up with their coursework or who need to complete a large amount of work in a short amount of time.\\n\\nAnother advantage of working from home is that it can provide a more personalized learning experience. When students are working from home, they have more control over their learning environment and can tailor it to their own needs. This can be particularly helpful for students who have different learning styles or who need more support in certain areas.\\n\\nOf course, there are also some disadvantages to working from home. One of the main disadvantages is that it can be difficult for students to stay motivated and on track. Without the structure of a school environment, students may struggle to stay focused and complete their work. Additionally, working from home can be isolating, which can make it difficult for students to feel connected to their peers and the school community.\\n\\nOverall, I believe that it is better for school students to work from home rather than in school. While there are some benefits to working in school, such as access to resources and opportunities for socialization, the ease of access to resources and the amount of work that gets done are ultimately more important factors to consider.

       " 'Technology to read students emotions in classrooms are not valuable to me. I think using money on things like this is stupid. There are plenty of other things this money could be used on other than knowing students emotions. Maybe Thomas Huang can Find a way to help teachers teach without boring their students.\\n\\nWhen looking at paragraph 7 it is telling us how to simply do this at school while looking in the mirror. People might try using your home PC but you computer cannot handle complex algorithms. You might want to grab a partner to do this with. The passage says,\"In fact, these are the instructions for a face that looks happy.\" If the teacher used the Facial Action Coding System they would have to stop in the middle of class to have the computers on. Also read all the emotion just for them to know that they may or may not be entertaining their classes enough or that a student may be confused, thats why students need to raise their hand more. I really dont think its necessary that they have this in a classroom. This would be great to try if the teacher doesn\\'t have anything plannned for the day. In paragraph 9 it says doing this experiment can make you feel slightly happy. Text says,\" Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.\" In chapter 6 it says that it can make computer-animated faces more expressive for things like video games or video surgery. Its a good thing because most human communication is nonverbal, incuding emotional communication.\\n\\nAs I said earlier, I do not think this software is valuable in classrooms to read the emotional expressions of students.

       " 'The people want what the people want. My idea is supported towards popular vote due to how unfair Electoral college really seems. My claim is that, popular voting is more fair, most liked and the people get what they want.\\n\\nI believe that the idea of a popular vote to elect the president is a way better idea than Electoral College. In Electoral college your vote actually goes to the electors of the canidates, and they get to elect the president. So in a way people don\\'t really get who they vote for. \" When you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates electors \", proof there to tell you the president you want is not really who you\\'re voting for. \" Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election like we have now \" direct evidence that shows more people want a direct vote so they arn\\'t being lied to, get worried or even angry. The winner-take-all system really had an effect on the people in the past due the way some states could never see the candidates so they knew that they had no chance of winning. Now Electoral College may be unfair and outdated but some people still support it and like the ways of it.\\n\\nThe Electoral College is considered an anachronism, or just not fit best for the present time. Basically each party selects electors and then they vote for that party\\'s nominee. The winner-take-all method is really what the Electoral college is all about, what is does is gets voters in toss up states to pay close attention to the campaign and on average are the most thoughtful voters and on average usually decide who will win the election. The Electoral College usually balences the voting considering large states gets more attention from presidential campaigns then a small state would \"... restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states\\xa0 lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the constitution \". Although some people want a political reference rather then one single vote deciding on who the winner of the election is.\\n\\nIn conclusion I agree more on the side of a popular vote rather than the Electoral College. It just has a more fair advantage and it supports my claim, popular voting is more fair, most supported and just overall better for the time being.

       " \" 1. It's common for students of different ages to struggle with understanding each other's work. For instance, young students often have difficulty grasping the complex concepts that older students take for granted. Teaching young students can be challenging, especially when they struggle to remember the material from previous grades, as I have experienced with my little sister. Older students may also find it difficult to teach young students, as they have different teaching methods and may not always explain things in a way that is easily understood by the younger students. To effectively teach young students, it is essential to have a lot of passion and to be able to explain concepts in a way that is clear and easy to understand.\\n2. I believe that many students struggle to understand complex concepts because they are simply not exposed to them in the same way as older students. Older students may be able to explain things more clearly than their teachers, but this is not always the case. As an adult, I have found that asking questions and seeking clarification from others can be very helpful in understanding complex concepts. This is particularly true when it comes to math, as there are often multiple ways to approach a problem. While it may be challenging to understand different teaching methods, it is important to be open to learning from others and to seek out additional resources to help clarify any concepts that are difficult to grasp.\\n3. I have found that it can be challenging to understand complex concepts when there are too many different teaching methods being used. In my math program, for example, my teacher and I often use different approaches to teaching the same material. While this can be helpful in providing students with a variety of perspectives, it can also be confusing for students who are trying to understand the material. In these situations, it can be helpful to seek out additional resources or to work with a peer or tutor who can help clarify the material.\\n4. I believe that students of all ages benefit from having someone to guide them and help them understand complex concepts. Whether there is only one student or a group of students, it is important to have someone who can provide individualized attention and support. While it may be challenging to provide this level of support to a large group of students, it is important to make every effort to do so. This may involve breaking the class into smaller groups or providing additional resources to help students who are struggling to understand the material.\\n5. Paying attention is an essential skill\",\n",
       " 'Have you ever been asked for advice? Or asked for advice from someone? Or even a group of people? Well, I have. I believe that if you ask multiple people for advice, it could be very beneficial towards you. If multiple people help your situations, in which you asked for advice on, it can help you see different point of views and come to a better decision. All of this can improve the very important life skills of perspective and open mindedness.\\n\\nNow, you might be thinking to yourself, \"She\\'s crazy, I only need one persons advice\". Well, imagine how much better it would be to look at your situations from different angles. Wouldn\\'t that be pretty nice? By getting multiple peoples inputs, you are also raising your trait of perspective. What is perspective, you ask? Perspective is being able to look at a situation and not just picture one scenario or solution, but multiple. This trait can get you very far in life. An example is if a student applies to colleges, he or she needs to look at multiple reasons to pick that specific school.\\n\\nAnother reason on why asking multiple people for advice is better than asking one is because not only will you gain more knowledge about one trait, you\\'ll gain two. The other trait is open mindedness. Have you ever heard someone say, \"You have to be more open minded.\"? Well, what they mean by that is that you or whoever they\\'re talking to, has to not be so closed in on one idea. One of my personal experiences, is when I was doing kick boxing. I did kick boxing my whole life and I loved it, but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s the only sport I can do for the rest of my life. So, I decided to do volleyball too. I did this because I had to be open minded\\xa0to other sports other than kick boxing.\\n\\nMy last reason is about the people you get advice from. I don\\'t know about you, but I have multiple people in my life who are important, not just one. You probably do too. The people you get you advice from, can be crucial to your decision. I only ask for advice from people I trust such as family, teachers, and my best friend. People you trust and love most likely trust and love you just as much or maybe even more. If they don\\'t want to see you hurt or unsuccessful, they wouldn\\'t give you bad advice. When I need advice, I ask my mom, my grandma, and my best friend. I do this because they all give support to the answers they give me. Also, if it is a \"yes or no\" question, I can use the majority rules system.\\n\\nIn conclusion, asking for advice from multiple people will make the decision more successful than just asking one person. This is because you will learn and gain very important life skills such as perspective and open mindedness, and because you can ask multiple people that you adore and trust. Now tell me, what will you do with your advice next time? Ask one person? Or two? Or maybe even more? Next time, use these examples to think about how many people to ask for advice.\\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   \\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0',\n",
       " 'First impressions are an important aspect of our lives. They are the initial judgments we make about someone or something, based on our first encounter with them. First impressions can have a significant impact on our relationships with others, as they often shape our perceptions and attitudes towards people. In this essay, I will analyze the importance of first impressions and share my experiences and opinions to support my conclusions.\\n\\nFirst impressions are often based on physical appearance, body language, and tone of voice. These initial judgments can be influenced by factors such as age, gender, race, and socioeconomic status. For example, someone who is dressed in a professional manner may be perceived as more trustworthy and reliable than someone who is dressed casually. Similarly, someone who speaks confidently and clearly may be perceived as more intelligent and competent than someone who speaks hesitantly or with a heavy accent.\\n\\nOnce we have formed our initial impressions of someone, these judgments can influence our behavior and interactions with them. If we have a positive first impression, we may be more likely to approach and engage with the person. On the other hand, if we have a negative first impression, we may avoid the person or dismiss them as unimportant. This can lead to missed opportunities for forming meaningful relationships and can also lead to misunderstandings and conflicts.\\n\\nPersonally, I have experienced the impact of first impressions on my relationships with others. In high school, I once had a classmate who I initially found intimidating due to their confident and outgoing demeanor. However, as I got to know them better, I realized that they were actually very kind and caring. If I had not initially judged them based on their first impression, I may have approached them sooner and formed a stronger friendship.\\n\\nIn conclusion, first impressions are an important aspect of our lives and can have a significant impact on our relationships with others. While physical appearance, body language, and tone of voice can influence our initial judgments, it is important to remember that these impressions are not always accurate. By being open to forming relationships with people based on more than just their first impression, we can miss out on valuable opportunities for connection and understanding.

       " \" In today's society, it is becoming increasingly common for young people to have a clear idea of what they want to do in life by the time they enter high school. While this may seem like a good idea, I believe that students should not commit to a career at a young age.\\n\\nOne of the main reasons why I believe this is because committing to a career can lead to a great deal of stress. For example, students may feel pressured by their parents or teachers to choose a career before they have even had the chance to fully explore their options. This can lead to feelings of anxiety and uncertainty, as students may feel like they have made the wrong decision or that they will not be able to find a career they truly enjoy.\\n\\nAdditionally, students may change their minds about the career they want as they get older. When they are young, they may have a strong idea of what they want to do, but as they gain more knowledge and experience, they may find that their interests and passions have shifted. This can lead to feelings of disappointment and frustration, as they may feel like they have wasted time and resources on a career that they are no longer interested in.\\n\\nFurthermore, students may not even know what they want to do in life when they are young. They may be too focused on other things, such as schoolwork or socializing, to fully consider their career options. This can lead to a sense of confusion and uncertainty, as they may feel like they are not making any progress towards their goals.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while it may seem like a good idea to commit to a career at a young age, I believe that students should not do so. Committing to a career can lead to a great deal of stress, and students may change their minds about the career they want as they get older. Furthermore, students may not even know what they want to do in life when they are young. Instead, I believe that students should focus on exploring their options and gaining experience, so that they can make an informed decision about their career when the time is right.\",\n",

       " 'The author well supports their idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite its dangers. They give evidence supporting the importance of Venus\\'s past, its general beneficiality, and how it could positively affect our future.\\n\\nExploring Venus is useful because its past is similar to Earth\\'s present state. The passage states that Venus is closest to Earth in density and size, then that \"astromomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.\" By exploring the planet and its past, more understanding on its inhospitable fall would be known, and potentially used in the research of space travel and comprehension. Since Venus and Earth were so similar, it is likely that at some point Earth will have the same result as its sister planet.\\n\\nStudying Venus also offers general beneficiality to space research. In the passage it says that Venus is occasionally the closest in distance to Earth. Because the distance is the shortest, the time neccessary to travel to, and thus, get feedback from, is also the shortest. Whether that be general information about interplanetary travel or information specific to Venus itself, the quickness alotted due to the distance is very useful since traveling in space has a very large time scale.\\n\\nThe future of technology and inhabitants on Earth can greatly improve with the study of Venus. By creating technology durable enough to withstand the intense weather and atmospheric conditions of Venus, it could prove to be durable enough for other planets that we could colonize. The author describes Venus\\'s conditions as, \". . .temperatures averaging over 800 degreen Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric preassure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" To create machines and substances that can withstand these circumstances can be used for a multitude of things, both on Earth and in space.\\n\\nThe author has clearly proven that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit through these points, and more. Much evidence was given like general facts or statistics, along with a series of inferences that explain how Venus has the potential to be a large benefactor in interplanetary travel.',\n",
       " \"The extensive use of car transportation is setting a cloud over our society, literally. Car transportation is so heavily depended on in the current generation that people don't realize the negatives it has on our environment, local businesses, and people's lives in general. transportation is not a priority and there are numerous advantages to gain out of limiting the use of cars the smog percentages in the atmosphere will decline and create an everlasting clear environment and magnificent clarity built skies, local businesses that are run by families in suburbs will see their popularity rising back up to their previous points before malls in distant areas took over, the stress of supporting a cars expenses will be relieved, and people will realize that we connect just as well through the internet rather than driving to meet friends.\\n\\nAlthough cars are used by a vast amount of the population, the impact it has on the environment is withoutadoubt an ongoing situation that needs to be taken care of. The author states in the passage that passenger cars are responsible for 12% of Greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some car intensive areas in the United States. That should automatically tell you that these vehicles are putting an impact on our environment. Limiting the permission that citizens have of using their cars temporarily has shown a massive decrease in the smog build up that takes up a rather large percentage in most cities, in source 2, paragraph 12 the author states the outcome of Paris permitting drivers with evennumbered licenses from driving this saw smog levels clear up enough to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday. If only temporarily holding people back from driving can affect our environment so positively, imagine what the output would be if the world repeated this action on a much larger scale.\\n\\nFurthermore, cars promote the popularity of malls, which takes away the attention from numerous local businesses. These local stores are ran by families that need customers to keep their system alive, and if cars are traveling a further distance to reach malls, it just takes away the money needed by these local businesses. Living in small communities and suburbs is a great solution to this problem and has proven to work already, for instance The suburb of Vauban, Germany stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant high way.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limititing car usage would be the lessening of stress, so many people have the burden of paying expensive car bills and having to work more than one job just to keep up with the numerous payments cars require, accidents are also caused by the massive amount of cars that are already in use on the roads. If people would carpool more often or take public transporations such as buses and trains, we would see an immense improvement of families income and we'd expect a safer society as a whole, safer from the hazards caused by the humongous majority of vehicle transportation. Having a car isn't a priority, working a job close to home and using bus transportation will be benfitial to your community, just plan out your approach and you'll soon understand why having a car isn't always necessary.\\n\\nAll in all, putting a stop to the extensive of cars will mainly bring out the pros, people always say they want to see the world become less polluted and free from toxic gases, limiting car usage is the first step to achieving this goal as we'd see smog in our skies clear out, your local businesses can step back into popularity and connect your community even more rather than traveling a far distance to reach malls. And finally, one of the main advantages would be the effect is has on you. All your money stresses will be relieved and you'll be able to focus on something more important than a car bill. The world is noticing these possibilities and we are heading for a chage on step at a time.\",\n",

The thought of having try to get a C average while trying to learn wrestling moves, football plays, basketball plays etc. It wouldn't be fare to the student playing sports.\\n\\nLike with football you have to study the play book or your going to walk on the field and not know what to do.

You also have think about how much time you miss at school playing sports.\\n\\nYou can miss tests due to games, practices, and tournaments. Just don't higher the grade to a B.\\n\\nThe only way I think heightening the grade to a B is if you have an in school program where you can do homework and study during lunch or another class like study hall. Have a teacher sit in a class room and give the athletes their homework and things they need to study and let them do it. Its a very good very logical solution. Athletes can also do missed tests and projects in study hall if they don't have time at home. So please if your going to change requirements to a B average at least give athletes study hall.\",\n",
       " 'As the debate over school schedules continues to be an ongoing issue, an innovative idea has been proposed: reduce the number of school days from five to four, and increase the length of each day to two extra hours. While this idea has drawn both support and criticism, there are many valid arguments in favor of the four-day school week with two extra hours of school each day. \\n\\nFirst, a four-day school week would reduce stress by allowing students, teachers and staff more time to socialize, participate in extra-curricular activities, or pursue hobbies. The extra two hours per day would also allow teachers to dig deeper into their subjects and help students stay engaged and focused. Furthermore, a four-day school week would provide an economic benefit, as schools would need fewer personnel to clean and maintain the buildings. Plus, this would give families a bit of a break when it comes to childcare responsibilities, as they could use those days to plan activities, run errands, or simply get some much-needed rest. \\n\\nUltimately, a four-day school week with two extra hours of school each day would be beneficial for everyone involved. Students would have fewer days to feel anxious and overwhelmed, while still having the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the subjects they are studying. Additionally, the cost savings for schools would be a welcome bonus. In short, moving to a four-day school week with two extra hours of school each day represents an innovative way of ensuring students receive a quality education while reducing stress and providing a cost-effective solution for schools.',\n",

He had to deal with a lot of challenges from birth until he immigrated to the US.\\n\\nFirst, he had to deal with the war. His town was constantly being bombed, and he had to hide in bomb shelters a lot. He even lost his parents when they were bombed out of their house.

       " 'Technology has become an integral part of modern life with its presence felt everywhere from the workplace to the home. While technology provides numerous positive effects for our lives, it also has numerous negative consequences. \\n\\nOne of the major positive impacts of technology is the ability to enhance physical growth. Modern technology has improved the quality of life of people, especially those who lead an active lifestyle by increasing the range of activities available to them. A great example of this is the development of specialized physical training software and devices, such as fitness trackers and sports gear, that can be used to chart progress and set goals for athletes of all levels.\\n\\nOn the other hand, technology can also have a harmful effect on physical health. With so much time spent on devices and screens, people are becoming increasingly sedentary, leading to obesity and other physical health issues. Additionally, the development of gaming technology has been linked to a decrease in physical activity among children, which can have a negative effect on their overall growth and development. \\n\\nTechnology also has a notable impact on learning, both in terms of the quantity and quality of the learning experience. On one hand, technology has made learning easier and more accessible by providing access to educational material and resources at any time and any place. On the other hand, technology has made it easier for people to become absorbed in entertainment and social media, resulting in a decrease of focus on more important topics or educational activities that require more in-depth engagement. \\n\\nFinally, technology has also had an impact on time management and lifestyle changes. Technology can help people become more productive with tools such as online calendars and task management apps. However, technology can also lead to distraction and over-dependence – people can become overwhelmed by the vast number of tasks and end up spending an excessive amount of time on their devices trying to stay on top of their workload. \\n\\nIn order to reap the benefits of technology while mitigating the negative impacts, it is important to set boundaries and practice healthy device usage. Limiting the use of phones, tablets, and computers to certain times, or utilizing digital wellness solutions such as screen time trackers, can help people find the right balance between technology and their other interests and activities. Additionally, encouraging physical activity and setting aside time for self-care activities such as reading and playing sports can help people discover a healthier lifestyle.',\n",

In a world that is constantly trying to make us something else, it is essential to hold onto our unique identities and not let anyone else define us.\\n\\nOne of the main themes that come to mind when thinking about this topic is individuality. It is crucial to be true to ourselves and not try to fit into someone else\\'s mold.

The phone can wait!\\n\\n\"Nine people are killed and more than 1,000 injured in crashes involving a distracted driver in the United States each year,\" stated by the Mila Araujo in her writing \"Dangers of distracted driving: Definition, Stats, and Risks for Teens.\" Distracted driving isn\\'t just being on your phone, but also eating while driving, playing around, or looking at other things instead of the road. Basically, distracted driving is when your doing everything else but focusing on the road while driving. \"9 percent of fatal crashes and 15 percent of injury crashes due to distracted driving, and an 8 percent increase in all distracted driving fatalities since 2016,\" according to the NHTSA. As you can see distracted driving is extremely dangerous.\\n\\nDistracted driving affects teenagers more than anyone else. Studies show that more than half of teenagers involved in an accident admitted to it being because of distracted driving. That is to say, \"Teenagers have the highest rate of crashes of any age group in the United States,\" stated by Mila Araujo. Teenagers these days are so attached to their phones to where it\\'s apart of their daily lives. They feel the need to respond to a text or look on social media constantly to where it becomes a habit, and when they get behind the wheel they automatically look on their phones when a simple buzz goes off. Teenagers who are driving risks their lives every time they pick up their phone behind the wheel.\\n\\nHowever, in Georgia they passed a hands free law July 1, 2018 which states that any driver driving a motor vehicle are prohibited from holding, watching, recording, writing, texting, etc. In my opinion, I feel as if every state in the United States should pass this law as it would reduce the amount of fatal accidents. There are many ways to prevent distracted driving at any age. One way is to put your phone on \"Do Not Disturb\" until you have reached your destination. If you are using your GPS for finding a location type in the desired location before you start operating the vehicle and review the directions. To prevent yourself from touching your phone use a phone holder for your car. These may save your life from any fatal accidents while behind the wheel.\\n\\nIn conclusion, many people are distracted while driving which is risking their lives.

       " \"The legalization of marijuana is a topic that has been talked about for a long time. Some people believe that it would be a good thing for our society, while others think it would be harmful. In my opinion, the legalization of marijuana would be a bad idea.\\n\\nFirst of all, marijuana is a drug that can be harmful to our health. It can affect our brain, lungs, and heart. It can also lead to addiction, which can ruin people's lives. If marijuana is legalized, more people will start using it, and this could lead to more health problems.\\n\\nSecondly, legalizing marijuana would give the wrong message to our youth. Children look up to adults as role models, and if they see that it's okay to use marijuana, they might be tempted to try it out themselves. This could lead to a rise in drug use among young people, which would have negative consequences for their future.\\n\\nThirdly, marijuana is a gateway drug. This means that people who use it might move on to more dangerous drugs like cocaine or heroin. If marijuana is legalized, it could lead to an increase in the use of these other drugs, which would be a disaster for our society.\\n\\nFinally, legalizing marijuana would make it easier for people to drive under the influence. Marijuana affects our judgment and reaction time, and driving after using it is just as dangerous as driving drunk. If marijuana is legalized, there could be more accidents and fatalities on our roads.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the legalization of marijuana would be a bad decision. It would have negative effects on our health, youth, and society as a whole. Instead of legalizing it, we should focus on educating people about the dangers of drug use and finding ways to help those who are struggling with addiction.\\n\\nNote: The essay above is a sample essay written in response to the prompt.

This issue has been a hot topic of debate for many years, and it is important to consider the potential risks that come with distracted driving.\\n\\nFirstly, using a cell phone while driving can be incredibly dangerous. When a driver is texting, scrolling through social media, or even making a call, their attention is taken away from the road. This can lead to accidents, injuries, and even deaths. In fact, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that distracted driving is responsible for over 3,000 deaths per year in the United States alone.\\n\\nIn addition, the use of cell phones while driving can also be a distraction to other drivers on the road. When a driver is not paying attention to the road, they may swerve into other lanes, brake suddenly, or miss important road signs. This can lead to confusion, frustration, and ultimately, more accidents.\\n\\nSome may argue that hands-free devices are a safe alternative to holding a cell phone while driving. However, even with hands-free technology, a driver is still distracted. Studies have shown that using a hands-free device can be just as dangerous as holding a cell phone while driving. This is because the driver's mind is still divided between the road and the conversation they are having.\\n\\nIn conclusion, drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. The risks far outweigh the benefits, and it is important to prioritize the safety of everyone on the road. If we want to reduce the number of accidents caused by distracted driving, it is time to put our phones down and focus on the road ahead.\",\n",
       " \"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:\\n\\nI strongly disagree with the school board's recent decision to add an extra half hour to the school day. While I understand the intention behind this decision, I believe it will have a negative impact on students' lives.\\n\\nFirstly, adding an extra half hour to the school day means that students will have less time with their families. As an 8th grader, I value my time with my parents and siblings, and I don't think I should have to sacrifice that time for more school. I believe that family time is important for our mental and emotional well-being, and reducing it will only make us feel more stressed and overwhelmed.\\n\\nSecondly, the extra half hour will also affect students' participation in sports and other extracurricular activities. Many of us rely on these activities to stay active and healthy, both physically and mentally. By adding more time to the school day, we will have less time to practice and play the sports we love, which will negatively impact our performance and overall enjoyment.\\n\\nThirdly, the extra half hour will make it harder for students to attend doctor's appointments and other important events. As a student, I know that sometimes we need to go to the doctor or dentist during school hours, and the extra half hour will make it harder to schedule these appointments. This will not only be inconvenient for us, but it will also affect our overall health and well-being.\\n\\nLastly, I think the school board should consider the length of the school day itself. As it is, our school day is already quite long, and adding more time to it will only make it more exhausting. I believe that students need a decent amount of time to rest and recharge, both physically and mentally, and the extra half hour will take away from that.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while I understand the school board's intention behind adding an extra half hour to the school day, I strongly disagree with this decision. I believe that it will negatively impact students' lives by reducing their time with their families, affecting their participation in sports and other extracurricular activities, making it harder to attend doctor's appointments, and taking away from the amount of\",\n",
       " \"Teachers should be the ones to designed summer projects because, they are more experienced at giving out projects and homework based assingments then students. A teacher can explain things way better than students can, and will help you out if you got questions. They can hand you out a list of the things that are required to do the summer project, or a rubric paper. Most students would prefer to design the project themselves, but it would not benefit them because it makes it easy on themselves, therefore they aren't learning anything. It would be easy for them and some students wouldn't do it because it's summer time.\\n\\nI don't like the idea that students should be doing summer work because its our break time. Schools should take in consideration, that students spent a whole year doing loads of work and learning. Nobody wants to be doing work over the summer, so if a student makes a project for the whole school students would be less likely to do it. Student have a better understanding of the work if a teacher did it then another student making the project. Also not every student can agree with another student because some students don't have any creativity, where as if a teacher did everyone can agree.\\n\\nI don't like the idea of some schools only worrying about us learning, that they decide to give us work during our summer time. Some parents wouldn't like the idea of summer work because, some families travel or go on vacation for the summer. Not every student has the same capability to make a summer project. First some teachers wouldn't be able to understand every kids individual work, where as if a teacher assinged the project she would understand because everyone has the same project. We are all human beings, we all breath the same air, and we all feel the same way about doing work during the summer.\\n\\nSchools think that we become lazy over the summer and that we forget about what they tough us when we were still in school. Life isn't just about doing school work all the time, we should be able to enjoy it and not have to worry about education all the time. We spend part of our life in school and when we try to have fun, they still want their students to always worry about it. Lastly I don't think teachers want to always be grading projects.\\n\\nIn Conclusion Teachers should be the ones to make the work that way everyone kows what their doing. The teacher can hand out a rubric about what the project is based on. Students would agree to do it more because, someone with experience made it and would be mandatory for them to do it. All and all students don't have enough experience and patients to make a project for everyone. If the project is worth a lot of points then they are also most likely to do it aswell because, it can impact their next year grade.\",\n",
       " 'Dear Principal,\\n\\nI believe that requiring students to perform community service is a great idea. Helping the community is a vital part of being a responsible citizen and can have a positive impact on both the individual and the community.\\n\\nMany of my friends already perform community service and have found it to be a rewarding experience. For example, some tutor elementary school children, which not only helps the children but also helps my friends develop their communication and leadership skills. Others clean up litter in our neighborhood, which helps to keep our community clean and beautiful.\\n\\nRequiring community service would not only benefit the community but also the students themselves. It would teach us the importance of giving back and help us develop a sense of social responsibility. It would also provide us with valuable skills and experiences that we can use in the future.\\n\\nAdditionally, community service can help to bring people together and promote a sense of community. When we work together to help others, we build relationships and develop a sense of belonging. This can help to create a more positive and supportive environment in our school and community.\\n\\nOf course, some of my friends may feel that community service takes too much time away from what they need or want to do. However, I believe that the benefits of community service far outweigh any potential drawbacks. Not only does it help the community, but it also helps us as individuals to grow and develop.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that students should be required to perform community service. It would be a valuable learning experience, promote social responsibility, and help to build a stronger community. I urge you to consider implementing a community service requirement for all students.\\n\\nThank you for your time and consideration.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n[Your Name]',\n",
       " \"Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,\\n\\nCommunity service is a great help to our society and not enough people do it. Some people think that community service takes up to much time in the day so they might not be able to do more fun things such as play sports or associate with friends. Although this may be true, community service is an ecstatic deed that everyone can do to serve our community. All in all, our school should be required to have our students do community service, and here's why.\\n\\nCommunity service includes things such as helping the elderly, tutoring children, and even picking up litter. These may sound like tedious deeds, but where would the world be without people doing these things? We would all be rolling around in our own filth and our education would suffer from lack of mentors. Although they may be a pain to do, our school needs to try our hardest to get it done for our community.\\n\\nStudies show that only 24% of people who know what community service is have actually performed an act of it. That leaves 76% of people who have not. Eventually, those numbers will come back to haunt us unless we do something about it. What we need to do is make our students perform community service. It doesn't have to be a lot, but something as simple as picking up trash around the campus or even helping a younger child get an A on a test. Whatever the deed may be, it will be helpful.\\n\\nAnother reason our school should make it mandatory to perform community service is that not enough students exercise. This may sound very cliche, but community service can also be a part of a physical education class, that way they are helping their community and they are benefiting from exercise. If we are to do this, it should not be a semester long thing, but maybe a week long unit of all the students chipping in to help better their community. And maybe our school could also start a club or group for the children who want to continue to better their community. Not only that, but it would also count as an extracurricular activity, which would help students in college and beyond.\\n\\nIf our school were to form a club or group for this, then many students would probably be associated with that club and that would spark others to join thereby creating a chain reaction of community service. If we can do that, then these children might continue it into the next generations and continue the chain of community service and help make the world a better place.\\n\\nAll in all, our school should defiantly consider making community service a necessary thing for our students. If we do this then it will help to make our community a better place, which is what we want for it. We can add community service into our physical education classes or maybe any other class, but in some way, shape, or form, we need to have community service in our school. So if you can please consider my thoughts and also consider adding community service then it would be much obliged. Thank you.\\n\\nSincerely, STUDENT_NAME\",\n",

This is really important for people who are looking for jobs or trying to do research for school.\\n\\nAnother reason why libraries are still important is that they have lots of books and other resources that you can't find online. Sure, you can find lots of information on the internet, but sometimes it's not reliable or accurate. Books are a great way to get reliable information, and librarians can help you find what you need. Plus, lots of people like to read books for fun, and libraries have tons of great books to choose from.\\n\\nLibraries also provide a quiet and safe space for people to study and learn. You can't always find a quiet place to study at home, but libraries have lots of study tables and comfy chairs where you can work without distractions. And, librarians can help you with your questions and make sure you're staying on task.\\n\\nFinally, libraries are a great place to meet new people and make friends. You can go to book clubs, author talks, and other events that libraries host. This is really important for people who are shy or new in town.\\n\\nIn conclusion, libraries are still really important in the digital age.

For example, in paragraph 14 said \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after five days of intensifying smog..... The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world\" what this mean is that if the cold came and there are warmer days this can caused the layer in the air to trap the car emissions, which then will create pollution.

       " \"I believe that this is a good policy that you must have at least a B average to participate in sports or other school activities. I think this is a good policy because for some people high school is difficult enough when your not busy and all those programs can distract you from doing good in school. Sports can be distracting because instead of studying for a test you might have to go to practice or go to a game.\\n\\nAnother reason why this is a good policy is because in sports you don't always make it on a college team or a pro team and then you have to get a regular job. If you didn't get good grades in high school then you it's harder for you to find a job in this job market. Companies would much rather hire a person that got a B or A average than a person that got a C or D average who played sports in high school. That's just how it works just because it's much more of a struggle to find a job now than in the twentieth century.\\n\\nAlso this is a good idea because it could set an example for some younger athletes that want to continue to play sports that they have to keep their grades up in order to play. If they didn't decide to use this policy then some people might not even try to get good grades and just worry about sports.\\n\\nThere's one thing bad about the policy though. I believe that they should wait a while before they pass this policy to give some students sometime to learn some healthier studying methods. If they pass it in the middle of the school year most students will not have enough time to make the change.\\n\\nOverall i think that this policy is good and won't be surprised if it does get passed considering how so many politicians are raising issues of how the nation's kids are learning            \",\n",

You don't have to worry about anyone else's opinions or ideas messing up your work.\\n\\nBut,  working with a group has its benefits too.  For instance, when you're working with others, you can bounce ideas off each other and come up with something way better than you could have on your own.  Like, when my friends and I are working on a project together, we can brainstorm and come up with new ideas that we wouldn't have thought of if we were working alone.  Plus, it's more fun to work with others!  You get to hang out with your friends and work on something together.\\n\\nHowever,  working with a group can also have its drawbacks.  For example, sometimes people can be really annoying or not pull their weight when it comes to doing their part.

Additionally, dress codes can help to promote a sense of unity and equality among students, as everyone is dressed in a similar manner, which can help to reduce social conflicts and bullying.\\n\\nFor example, in my school, we have a dress code that requires students to wear collared shirts, dress pants or skirts, and closed-toe shoes.

While it may seem like an easy solution to help students learn more, the reality is that most students are already struggling to keep up with their workload. Adding more hours to the school day would only make things worse, as students would have less time to relax and recharge.\\n\\nFurthermore, the added time would not necessarily translate into better learning outcomes. In fact, studies have shown that students who are overworked tend to perform worse academically than those who have a healthy balance of work and play. Instead of trying to cram more hours into the school day, schools should focus on finding ways to make the most of the time students do have.\\n\\nIn addition to the negative impact on students, teachers would also be affected by this change. Many teachers already have part-time jobs to supplement their income, and adding more hours to the school day would make it even harder for them to balance their work and personal lives. This could lead to burnout and a decrease in the quality of teaching.\\n\\nFinally, the added time would also put a strain on bus drivers. Driving a school bus in the morning when it's dark is already a risky job, and adding more hours to the school day would only make things worse. Bus drivers would have to drive even later in the day, which could be dangerous for both them and the students.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while the idea of adding more hours to the school day may seem like a good solution on the surface, the reality is that it would put too much pressure on students, teachers, and bus drivers.

       " 'There is no doubt that deciding to commit to a job at a young age can bring many advantages. Perhaps the biggest pro is the potential to gain invaluable experience early on. Having an opportunity to quickly build up knowledge and skills while still in school can give the young person a competitive advantage in the job market. In addition, a job can provide a young person with some financial stability to pay for college tuition or other expenses. \\n\\nHowever, there are also some potential cons to consider when committing to a job at a young age. For example, the rigid schedule of a full-time job may limit a young person’s ability to pursue other interests or activities such as volunteering, internships, and hobbies. Furthermore, trying to balance school work and a job can be challenging, leading to a lack of sleep or burnout. On top of that, a young person may face age-related discrimination in the workplace, making it difficult to get ahead. \\n\\nIn the end, deciding whether or not to commit to a job at a young age is an individual decision that needs to be carefully weighed. Being aware of both the potential pros and cons can help young people make informed decisions.',\n",

       " \"Cell phones have become an integral part of our daily lives. They are used for communication, entertainment, and even work. However, the use of cell phones in school has been a topic of debate for many years. Some people argue that cell phones are a distraction to students and can negatively impact their academic performance, while others believe that they can be a useful tool for learning. In this essay, I will argue against the use of cell phones in the classroom.\\n\\nFirstly, cell phones can be a major distraction to students. Studies have shown that students who use cell phones in class are more likely to miss important information and struggle to focus on the lesson. This is because cell phones are designed to be engaging and entertaining, and students are more likely to get caught up in social media, games, and other apps than paying attention to the teacher. Furthermore, cell phones can be a source of distraction for other students, as they may be tempted to check their phones or talk to their friends during class.\\n\\nSecondly, cell phones can negatively impact students' academic performance. Research has shown that students who use cell phones in class are more likely to have lower grades and test scores than those who do not. This is because cell phones can be a source of procrastination, as students may use them to browse social media or play games instead of completing their homework or studying for exams. Additionally, cell phones can be a source of distraction during class, as students may be tempted to check their phones or talk to their friends instead of paying attention to the lesson.\\n\\nFinally, cell phones can be a source of cheating in exams and assignments. With the internet at their fingertips, students can easily access answers to questions or cheat on tests and assignments. This not only undermines the value of education but also creates an unfair advantage for students who do not cheat. Furthermore, cheating on exams and assignments can lead to a lack of motivation and engagement in the classroom, as students may feel that they do not need to put in the effort to succeed.\\n\\nIn conclusion, cell phones can have a negative impact on students' academic performance, distraction, and cheating. While cell phones can be a useful tool for learning and communication, they can also be a source of distraction and cheating in the classroom. Therefore, it is important for schools to have policies in place that\",\n",

They can go to the library and use the computers there to look up information, do homework, or apply for jobs.\\n\\nEven for people who do have access to the internet, libraries are still important.

It was a just natural landform. It was not created by aliens.\\n\\nIt is, in fact, a mesa, or butte, like on earth. It is a platform of naturally formed rock on the surface of mars. The shadows on the mesa make it look kind of like a face, when it is actually just a natural formation. The picture showed the differet cracks and dips in the formaton that made the shadows on the mesa. In America, there are lots of different mesas, such as the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\\n\\nIt may look like a face on Mars, but that is ecaue of the Viking 1 didn\\'t have the most accurate cameras. The pictures were taken more than 35 years ago. They didn\\'t have cameras as advanced as we do. The Viking 1 took those pictures in 1976. Each pixel spanned 43 meters. That is not a very defined picture. In 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor took some pictures of the \"face\" with a more advanced camera at its highest resolution. Each pixel only spanned 1.56 meters. That means that its a very accurate picture. It showed how the \"face\" was actually a mesa.\\n\\nThere are always possibilities of alien life having to do with the formation, but that is a very very slim chance. Conspiracy theorists are not necessarily profesionals. NASA scientists can easily see how the face is just a formation. They would probably be really glad if the formation was made by extraterrestrials, but they know that it wasn\\'t made by aliens.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the \"face on Mars\" is just a land formation called a mesa. Scientists have taken more recent pictures with the Mars Global Surveyor to prove that it is a land formation. There is a possibility it was created by aliens, but it is illogical and not likely.

By doing this students will have the opportunity to help people in need, help the environment and feel good about doing things for their city. I think all student should be required to do at least 10 hours of community service each year and in this letter I will convince you of that!\\n\\nBy students performing community service it gives them the opportunity to have fun by helping the environment. For example, if all the students from each grade got together and went somewhere in their community and planted trees, that would be a great learning experience for the students and teaching them about how global warming is effecting our planet would be a great way for the teachers to encourage the children to do more with helping the environment.\\n\\nNext, by children performing more community service it gives them the chance to help others. For example, students could go on a field trip to a local nursing home or a homeless shelter and sing Christmas carols to the residents around Christmas time. I would have loved to have done something like that in school but it was never required that we do community service so it was not done. Also by doing this, the residents would enjoy it and would talk highly about the school.\\n\\nFinally, by children performing more community service students might feel good about themselves for helping others and the environment. Who could not feel good about helping others and making a difference? By feeling good about themselves students' self esteem level will increase and they will always remember what they did to help someone else and help the environment.\\n\\nI hope my reasons and examples have convinced you to require all students here at SCHOOL_NAME to perform community service.

She taught me that hard work and perseverance will always pay off, and to never be discouraged by failure. I've seen the power of this advice in my own life time and again; whenever I've faced a challenge I've never hesitated to keep going.\\n\\nMy dad's wisdom lies in showing me the value of gratitude.

I think it's unfair to force students to do something they don't want to do.

I spend a lot of time practicing and performing with my band, and I don't think I should have to give that up just because the Principal says so. Music is really important to me, and it's what I want to do.\\n\\nFurthermore, some students might not be able to participate in extracurricular activities due to their financial situation, family obligations or health issues. It's not fair to force them to participate when they might not have the means to do so.\\n\\nFinally, extracurricular activities should be a choice, not an obligation. Students should be able to decide for themselves what they want to do, and not be forced to do something they don't want to.

       " 'Making your own decisions without seeking advice from other individuals can lead to numerous negative outcomes, including hurt feelings and regret. People will often make decisions in their own best interest, which may not be reflective of the opinion of others, and this can lead to disagreements and upset. For example, a teenager might decide to skip class in order to meet up with friends, and the parents may take offense to this choice and become angry. This situation could easily have been avoided if the teenager had consulted his parents in order to reach an agreement that satisfied all parties.\\n\\nIn addition to hurt feelings, reaching out for advice can also be very helpful in making important decisions. Seeking input from individuals who have experience in the area can often lead to more successful outcomes than if the decision was made without considering multiple opinions. For instance, if a young couple is deciding whether to have children, they may feel more confident about their decision if they have consulted family and friends who have gone through the experience.\\n\\nIt is also important to remember that age is not a determinant when making important decisions. While wisdom does come with age, it is still important to seek opinions from individuals of all ages when making decisions as everyone can have something unique to offer. For example, if a college student is considering moving across the country to take a new job, they should seek out opinions from their peers, parents, and grandparents in order to approach the decision from all angles. \\n\\nIn conclusion, it is highly advisable for individuals to seek advice when making decisions in order to ensure successful outcomes and to avoid hurt feelings. Additionally, age should not be a determining factor in the decision making process as different age groups offer unique perspectives and insights.',\n",

       " \"Limiting car usage can bring about numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. The passages provided highlight some of the benefits of reducing car dependency, including decreased greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and enhanced quality of life in terms of reduced stress and better community connections.\\n\\nOne of the most significant advantages of limiting car usage is the impact it can have on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. According to experts, passenger cars are responsible for a significant amount of these emissions, with Europe and some areas in the United States having car-intensive regions where cars contribute up to 50% of greenhouse gas emissions. By reducing car usage, we can directly address this issue and help combat climate change.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can greatly improve air quality. The passage about Paris's driving ban due to smog highlights the detrimental effects of car emissions on the environment and public health. Cold nights and warm days trap car emissions, leading to intensified smog. By reducing car usage, we can minimize the release of harmful pollutants into the atmosphere, leading to cleaner and healthier air for everyone.\\n\\nIn addition to environmental advantages, limiting car usage can also enhance individual well-being. By relying less on cars, people can engage in more active forms of transportation like walking and cycling, leading to improved physical fitness and overall health. The excerpt from Vauban, Germany, demonstrates how residents who have given up their cars experience less stress and increased happiness. Walking and biking instead of driving can also create a sense of community as people interact with each other more frequently, fostering a stronger social connection.\\n\\nMoreover, limiting car usage can lead to smarter urban planning and more accessible public transportation. The passages mention the trend of separating suburban life from auto use, with the development of car-free communities and the placement of stores within walking distance. This approach allows for more compact and efficient living, reducing the need for large parking areas and promoting the use of public transportation. By designing communities that prioritize pedestrians and cyclists, we can create more sustainable and livable cities.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage offers several advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improvement in air quality, enhancement of individual well-being, and promotion of smarter urban planning. As these passages indicate, many cities and communities are already adopting measures to reduce car dependency and create more sustainable environments. By embracing alternative modes of transportation and rethinking our car culture, we can contribute to a healthier and more sustainable future.\",\n",
       " 'Limiting car usage is both safer and reduces the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. If more people decide to walk and bike the amount of smog in the area will decrease tremendously. Also by not using your car as much you can save money on gas to put towards other things.\\n\\nBy limiting car use it will greatly reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the air. In Paris the congestion went down 60 percent after the partial driving ban. Passenger cars are account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent is some places in the United States. Just by walking to work every other day or carpooling you can greatly reduce the amount of emission put out from your vehicle.\\n\\nIf there are less cars then the parking lots will be made smaller which allows more room for stores. Instead of having to drive five or ten miles to the nearest store it would be placed just a walk away. In Bogota, Columbia where they have the car-free day more parks and sports centershave popped up. There are new restaurants and shopping districts within walking distance to where people there live. It has als had 118 miles of new bicycle paths.\\n\\nNot using your car as often will save a ton of money. Think about how much you spend on gas. You could cut it in half by walking to work every other day or by carpooling with others. Even by just taking the bus you can help out because there is less traffic. There would be a decrease in the number of accidentsand you could get around quicker\\n\\nIf you were to limit your car usage you could help protect the environment and save money in the process. With less vehicles on the road it is a lot safer and there is much less traffic if people participate. If we limit driving then we can prevent global warming.    ',\n",

Employers are always looking for individuals who can take ownership of their work and consistently put in the effort to achieve their goals. In this essay, I will explore the importance of these qualities and provide examples of how they contribute to a successful career.\\n\\nFirstly, responsibility is a crucial quality that employers look for in their employees. Being responsible means taking ownership of your actions and being accountable for your mistakes. It involves being able to handle situations that arise and making decisions that can impact the success of the company. For example, if an employee is responsible for managing a project, they must be able to delegate tasks, communicate effectively with team members, and ensure that the project is completed on time and within budget. Employers value employees who are reliable and can be trusted to handle important tasks.\\n\\nSecondly, hard work is another essential quality that employers look for in their employees. Hard work is defined as the effort put into achieving a goal or completing a task. It involves being dedicated to your work and consistently putting in the time and effort to improve your skills and achieve success. For example, if an employee is working on a project, they must be willing to put in extra hours to ensure that the project is completed on time. Employers value employees who are willing to go the extra mile to achieve their goals.\\n\\nThe importance of responsibility and hard work cannot be overstated in the workplace. These qualities contribute to a successful career in many ways. Firstly, they help employees develop a strong work ethic, which is essential for achieving success in any field. Employees who are responsible and hardworking are more likely to be promoted to higher positions within the company, as they demonstrate the skills and qualities required to succeed.\\n\\nSecondly, responsibility and hard work help employees build strong relationships with their colleagues and superiors. When employees take ownership of their work and consistently put in the effort to achieve their goals, they are seen as valuable members of the team. This helps to build trust and respect, which are essential for success in the workplace.\\n\\nIn conclusion, responsibility and hard work are two of the most important qualities that an employee can possess in the workplace. Employers are always looking for individuals who can take ownership of their work and consistently put in the effort to achieve',\n",

Technology is coming far in this world, driverless are only the beginning.\\n\\nMy position on driverless cars are that I\\'m all for it. I believe that they would come in handy in the future. Even, if they are assisting you , who can\\'t use a little extra assisting? The article says, \" The most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof.

Those are two of the many ways that driverless cars are very helpful.\\n\\nWith new cars come new laws, and with these new laws come safer roads. Some new laws would have to be laws that cover liability in accidenys because who\\'s fault would it really be? In paragraph 9 it states, \" If technology fails and someone is injured who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?\", and they have a good point, but it would automatically be the manufacturer because the driver does not have full control over the car. The article also states, \"Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times\", which is why they wouldnt know who\\'s fault it would be. Therefore, the laws they crete are only meant to keep people safe.\\n\\nComing to a conclusion, I still believe that driverless cars are very helpful to people who could use them.

       " 'Through the past century, mechanization on a global scale has indubitably innovated the world in efficency and economic progress. In particular, however, the key invention of the car has solely shown the benefits of such techonological progress. For a few innovators, the mere invention of cars did not seem convincing enough, hence the creation of driverless automobiles has been in design to furtherly increase efficiency and safety. Although the benefits of adopting driverless cars in society seem convincing in progressing society, ultimately, the implementation of driverless cars will only entail disaster.\\n\\nA strong factor contributing to the cons of driverless cars is the undeniable usage of human skills throughout the road even with using driverless cars. Although the term \"driverless car\" may seem like a straight-forward terminology, it is in reality not. Currently, there is no such development of a car that completely remains independent of the car passenger. On paragraph 7 it notes, \"None of the cars developed so far are completey driverless.\" Morever, due to the fact that driverless cars cannot function completely by themselves, this requires that human passengers still have to be attentive at all times.\\n\\nAs continued on paragraph 7 it states, \" They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills.\" In summation, this means the human driver must continue to remain alert and be ready to take over the wheel if the driverless car cannot deal with a specific situation. Despite that driverless cars can permform tasks independently, it is only to a limited extent. Therefore, this still requires the full attention and driving skill set of the car driver. If this still requires the full attention and driving skills of the car driver, the invention of the carless driver, in reality, has no useful benefits. The driver therefore, still has risks of getting into car accidents because they still need to rely on their driving abilities, rendering the invention of driverless cars ineffective.\\n\\nThe most important factor of all in contributing against the promotion of driverless cars however, is the idea of fault. On paragraph 9, a controversial question is brought up, asking \"If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?\" If a driverless car were to get into an accident and if someone were to be injured as a result, who\\'s fault would it ultimately be? This serious and controversial argument as a result, creates a prodigious amount of conflict, particularly between drivers and manufacturers. Because driverless cars are most of the time, indepent of the car drivers, an accident caused by this invention will guaranteed cause a difficulty in finding who is truly at fault. On one hand, it could have been the driver himself for not paying attention to the road and altering the mechanics of the driverless car. However on the other hand, it could have been a completely honest mistake, where the driverless car itself commited an automated mistake that did not associate with the actions of the car driver.\\n\\nDriverless cars in conclusion, make it difficult to assert the blame on whos truly at fault in a driverless car accident, therefore making it extremely more difficult in handling and resolving this situation.\\n\\nWithout driverless cars, there will only be one to blame and therefore, more problems will be resolved.\\n\\nLastly, the existence of traffic laws and working zones on the roads is prominent in abasing the efficency of driverless cars. On paragraph 9 it says, \"Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times.\" In other terms, common aspects of the road, such as traffic laws and working zones, are designed so that only human drivers can handle those situations, thus making driverless cars useless. In these terms, this means that alert drivers will perform much more reliably than an automated car because the road and traffic laws are set up so that the only safe car is a car where a human driver is in control at all times. Because driverless cars are incapable of handling such pivotal features of the modern road system, they must still rely on their human drivers, contradicting their own title of \"driverless\" cars. In conclusion, because the driving laws of the road are mainly designed so that safety will be best achieved with alert human drivers, the implementation of driverless cars in modern society is utterly useless.\\n\\nDue to the manifestations of human action-based driving laws, continued necessity for human driving skills, and no exact blame for fault in a driverless car accident, the addition of driverless cars into society will only bring increased harm and debatable increased efficiency.\\n\\nThe addition of fully driverless cars is currently only fantasy, and should remain this way eternally.

       " 'Thomas Jefferson was a founding father of the United States and a prominent figure in American history. He was known for his writings on various topics, including the importance of avoiding idleness. In his essay \"The Art of Letter Writing,\" Jefferson wrote, \"A mind idle and unoccupied is the breeding-ground of mischief.\" This statement can be applied to modern life in several ways.\\n\\nFirstly, idleness can lead to boredom and a lack of purpose. When we are not engaged in meaningful activities, we are more likely to become restless and seek out ways to fill our time. This can lead to impulsive decisions and actions that may not be beneficial in the long run. For example, I have seen friends and family members become restless and bored during the summer months when they are not in school or work. They may spend their time engaging in reckless behavior or making poor choices that can have long-term consequences.\\n\\nSecondly, idleness can lead to a lack of productivity and efficiency. When we are not focused on a task or goal, we are more likely to waste time and resources. This can be seen in the workplace, where employees who are not fully engaged in their work may not be as productive as those who are actively working towards a goal. In my experience, I have seen colleagues who are not fully engaged in their work take longer to complete tasks and make more mistakes.\\n\\nFinally, idleness can lead to a lack of personal growth and development. When we are not actively engaging in learning and self-improvement, we are less likely to develop new skills and knowledge. This can limit our potential and prevent us from achieving our full potential. In my own experience, I have seen friends and family members who are not fully engaged in their personal growth become stagnant and unfulfilled.\\n\\nIn addition to avoiding idleness, not responding to provocation can also be beneficial in modern life. Jefferson wrote, \"A mind that is not fully occupied in some pursuit will soon find itself occupied in idle fancies.\" This statement highlights the importance of keeping our minds active and engaged. When we are not fully engaged in a task or goal, we may become distracted by idle thoughts or provocation from others. However, by not responding to provocation, we can maintain our focus and avoid getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Thomas Jefferson\\'',\n",

       " 'Cars. Everyday the average citizen uses a car to get around wether it be for groceries or just going to their job. It has gotten to the point that many people cannot imagine the idea of living without a car. For those few people who have made the switch to not using a car daily however, have experienced some good things about life without a car. In the passage set it explores the different positive side effects that can come along with not having a car from real life situations. There are many different things that can happen with just this one change and some of these examples you might not have thought about before.\\n\\nThe first two sources talk mostly about the environmental changes that having no cars could bring. Source one focuses on the greenhouse gasses that are produced from car usage. The article states \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.\" This is a huge deal because greenhouse gasses are belived to be responsible for global warming which could become a huge threat. Source two continues to bring up the air pollution problems that are ocurring in places around the world. Air pollution can cause a variety of problems from people having problems breathing to plants dieing. The problem has gotten so bad that \"Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city\". The problem of smog has gotten so serious that a whole community had to ban driving which is insane that it\\'s gotten that far. Limiting car usage could take car of our Earth the way it takes care of us.\\n\\nThe last two sources, sources 3 and 4, look at the way that limiting car ussage could improve our communites. Source three talks about how that cutting back on car ussage could benifit different parts of our surroundings. Near the end of the passage it says \"Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city\". It then continues to list off individual things like rush hour traffic being cut down and sidewalks that were in poor condition are perfect again. The last source talks about the economic benifits that having less cars operating could bring. As a result of the recession people were forced to get creative on how to save money in order to get by. One thing we did was cut back on the amount of gasoline we used which in turn led to us cutting back on the amount of driving we did. This boosted our economy and there in no reason why it can\\'t continue to boost our economy even further if we cut back our car usage even further.\\n\\nIn conclusion cutting back on how much we use our cars has many advantages that will benifit every person living today. There are even more advantages that were not mentioned in the sources above that will improve the world even more. Along with there being a ton of advantages, there are little to no disadvantages. Think to yourself of at least four advantages of increasing the amount of car usage. How many could you think of?    ',\n",
       " \"Imagine if you could realize your friends emotions all the time. Facial Action Coding Systems might be our new way to know how someone is feeling. New software is being developed to better comunicate emotions. What if we had this technology in schools? To better understand our peers and know if they are okay. This would be a tremendous advance in schools nowadays.\\n\\nIf we had this technology in school teachers could better understand their students. Teachers could find out how the student are feeling and adjust according to what the students are thinking. This machine would help classrooms everywhere because if a student is board of the lesson odds are they are not going to pay attention. A student is not always willing to talk to a teacher and tell them why they are not doing well or what they dont like about class. You cant always be perfect at guessing how someone is feeling by what you see because they could be hiding their emotions from you. People would think that the machine would not work right and it would be false information being read. The machine is constructed by callibrating it to recognize all 44 major muscles in the model to move exactly like humans move. The machine has six basic emotions happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. And along with the characteristics are movements of the facial muscles. Each one of the emotions are designed to be read of human facial movements to detect emotion. All the steps to constucting this machine are great and are taken off of human facial movement.\\n\\nFacial Action Coding machines could help teachers and staff stop suicidal thought or actions from occuring. Teachers are at school to help students and just the regular teacher dosen't always catch a student having a horrible day or getting bullied constantly. This machine could help teachers find the kids that are having it rough and sit down with them and talk. This machine would take away the amount of suicidal thoughts and even suicide at high schools all across the country.\\n\\nThis machine would help in many different catigories. If teachers started using this machine and making kids feel better everyday it would make students want to come back to school and want to learn. This would increase grades and student to teacher bonds. The students would carry that home and that would help parents. Kids would do more choirs and help around the house more. They would stop being so hostile twords their parents. This machine could bring so much good to schools and communities all across the world.\\n\\nAlthough this machine would be great to have in schools it could be taken as a privacy issue. Students might not feel comfortable if a teacher or elder has a machine that can read how they are feeling. This could be an issue for many parents as well. If a parent does not want this in the school their child goes to they are more than likely to take their child out of that school. This could provoke other parents as well to get the wrong idea about this machine. The parents could see this as a danger in a school because they would no nothing about the machine or the students could be frightened from this machine.\\n\\nTo conclude my essay I think this device would be a great thing to have in schools. It could prevent kids from being bullied, having suicidal thought or even being board in class. It would help teachers get the right idea of what to teach in class and get the idea of students that might be having a really hard time. All in all this machine would be a great tool to use in schools all across the world.\",\n",

       " 'UGH! \"I can\\'t focus at school anymore now that grandma is gone. Nothing feels the same anymore. I just wish I could work on my own time!\" Said Generic_Name. Generic_Name, we will do something about this, im always here to help, said her father Generic_Name. Some schools offer distance learning as a way to attend classes from home by a way of online or video conferencing. Do students benefit from being able to attend classes at home? I completely agree with this statement because it definetly can make a extraordinary change in ones students life for the better. Students wold benefit from this massively since less pressure would be applied on them and weight would get lifted off their shoulders. Students would have their own time to work and can take various different approaches in this situation.\\n\\nOne of the many reasons why students would benefit at home is because they have better work ethic. Everyone works better at home rather than school because less pressure is on oneself to do amazing by strict teachers and bossy students. My close friend Generic_Name, was once offered to take some of her college classes online rather than getting up at 8am, stressing herself out early in the morning, but at home she took a couple classes at noon and she gave in her best attempts than she had ever given at her early morning AP bio course. Another time, my brother Generic_Name, had been tutoring one of his fellow classmates Generic_Name online. Now before they had been working at the local library and Generic_Name barely understood anything because of the noises and hyper teenages there, Now from the comfort of their own homes, they video called eachother and Generic_Name started to go from 50\\'s to 90\\'s in just a week since he had a much better work ethic at home instead of in public with everyone around! Students do put in their best attempts and have a better work ethic at home freely rather than cramming themselves at school.\\n\\nNext, a students mental health plays a very huge role in this topic. My loving sister, Generic_Name, had been diagnosed with severe depression and social anxiety. She could barely force herself to wake up at 6 in the morning for school everyday since it was very dreadfull for her. Now when she switched from public school to online school, she was so much happier. I watched her eyes fill with joy and saw a bright light like I\\'ve never seen in my own sister in just a couple weeks into online classes. She finally got to be herself again without all the judgemental students at school telling her horrific things everyday and peer pressuring her to the max, she was finally happy and was back to getting all A\\'s in no time. Another time, my cousin Generic_Name was so worn out from the stress from school and college apps, he had decided to take online classes for college in order to work on bettering himself as a person for his own health. Online classes brought Generic_Name outside of the dark dungeon he was sitting in and changed his life for the better. Students would definetly benefit from taking online classes not only their grades, but as well as themselves, as a person.\\n\\nThird, another way students benefit by taking classes from the benefit of their own home, is because they get to spend more time with their loves ones. Now while in school, we leave early in the morning without getting to see our parents and with sports, clubs and extra curricular activities, by the time one gets home it is already very late and one misses out on seeing they\\'re parents since they are very busy with work as well. Now one of my good friends Generic_Name, lived with her grandma but was very busy with school and basketball practice and by the time she got home she was asleep, this continued on for 4 years, and once the time came, her grandma had unfortunetly passed away. \"WOW\" If I wasn\\'t always so busy with school and would\\'ve taken online classes, I would have much more time to spend with her. Now some may argue and disagree that students would not benefit from taking online classes due to most teens and adults are lazy and would never complete their work or assignments, but that statement is false because the ones who want to strive for the best and make better situations for themseves know how to manage their time properly and set goals for themselves in the future. There would be a drastic impact on students grades if they took online classes and would benefit in many different ways.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there would be many different positive results of distance learning. Now many may have heard of J.K Rowling, one of the best writers of the generation, she took many writing classes online which helped shape who she is today. She is known for being on of the best novelists today and she did not have time to go to early morning classes, but instead she chased her dream of becoming a writer and had not gone un noticed. Therefore we can fix this issue by offering a variety of classes online for future students instead of forcing them at an unreasonable time and by letting students to have a voice of their own to speak out. Students would see a great impact just by being able to attend classes from thier own homes!\\xa0   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0',\n",
       " \"cellphones and driving\\n\\nCellphones and driving has a lot to do with each other in this day and age because so many drivers feel the need to text and drive or to be on their phones in general. The fact that so many car accidents come from texting and driving yet people still do it is sickening. A lot of people have died from other people's mistakes yet people still do it on an everyday basis which is very crazy to think about.\\n\\nI strongly agree with cell phones being banned while driving. I can honestly say that I have almost run into someone's back on numerous occasions because I was focused on texting on my phone. I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents they are causing, it is causing one's insurance to rise, and it is causing concerns to people health issues. The question is people more concerned more with their conveniences more than they are with their safety or safety of others. It is a habit that spreads like STDs. In the long run, it is deadly as well Cell phones are the omnipresent electronic device of this era, and multitasking is the word of this generation so, it is quite natural to see many\\n\\nStudies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. Driving while using a cell phone to drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. If you have this habit, do not forget about this also. Banning cellphones while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving.\\n\\nAnother reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving, is to prevent car insurance from rising. In society, money is tight when it comes to doing different thing with the way the economy is now. If you can, try being careful because the money you put towards careless accident that can be prevented can be put toward a light bill, etc. The more the number of tickets you attract against your name, the higher the insurance will be. In recent studies companies are paying close attention to the link between cell phone use and car accident and many auto insurance websites warn of distracted driving. It states that the person that is at fault for a car accident caused by cell phone use or ticketed for talking on the phone while driving, their insurance premium is very likely to rise especially if their cause.\\n\\nPeople think they can drive good enough to have a conversation on the phone and still pay attention to everything else going on the road. In all reality no one on the planet is that good a driver to pay attention to everything going on around them and watch out for people while still texting or scrolling social media apps. Thank you for listening to what i had to say about cellphones and driving vehicles.\\n\\n2            \",\n",

Why I am in favor in keeping the Electoral College is why should we change something that's already working good. The Electoral college system is a system that voters vote not for the president, but for a slate who in turn elect the president. The electors can be anyone not holding public office. Why we should keep it is because we have been using it since 1960 and i dont see why change something that works, is slightly fair, and everybody is happy.\\n\\nThe electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by delcaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the electoral college method is not democractic in a modern sense.... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When tou vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors.\\n\\nThe reason is thatr the winning candidate's share of the electoral college incariably exceeds his shares of the popular vote.

       " \" When seeking advice, it's important to consider the benefits of consulting with multiple individuals versus just one. While it may be tempting to rely on the opinions of a single trusted source, there are several reasons why seeking advice from multiple people can be more beneficial.\\n\\nFirst, it's important to recognize that no one person has all the answers. Even the most knowledgeable and experienced individuals can have blind spots or biases that they may not be aware of. By seeking advice from multiple people, you can gain a more well-rounded perspective on a particular issue or decision. This can help you to identify potential risks or challenges that you may not have considered otherwise.\\n\\nSecond, seeking advice from multiple people can also help you to validate your own thoughts and ideas. When you present your ideas to multiple people, you can get feedback on what works and what doesn't. This can help you to refine your ideas and make more informed decisions. Additionally, hearing different perspectives can help you to identify areas where you may need to do more research or seek out additional information.\\n\\nFinally, seeking advice from multiple people can also help you to build relationships and expand your network. When you seek advice from others, you are essentially asking them to invest their time and expertise in helping you. This can help you to build stronger relationships with these individuals, and it can also open up new opportunities for collaboration and networking in the future.\\n\\nIn conclusion, seeking advice from multiple people can be a valuable way to gain a more well-rounded perspective on a particular issue or decision.

       " \"Volcanoes are one of the most fascinating natural phenomena that have been observed on Earth. They are geological formations that can be found in many parts of the world, including the Pacific Ring of Fire. Volcanic eruptions can have devastating effects on people and the environment, but they can also be an enjoyable educational activity. In this essay, we will explore what causes volcanoes to erupt, the layers of a volcano, and the effects of volcanic eruptions.\\n\\nVolcanic eruptions are caused by the movement of tectonic plates beneath the Earth's surface. When two tectonic plates collide, one plate is forced beneath the other, creating a subduction zone. As the plate is forced deeper into the Earth's mantle, it heats up and begins to melt, forming magma. The magma rises through the Earth's crust, forming a volcano.\\n\\nThe layers of a volcano are divided into three main types: the cone, the magma chamber, and the mantle. The cone is the visible part of the volcano, and it is made up of solid rock and ash. The magma chamber is the reservoir of molten rock beneath the cone, and it is where the magma rises before it is expelled during an eruption. The mantle is the layer of the Earth's mantle that is closest to the surface, and it is where the magma originates.\\n\\nVolcanic eruptions can have devastating effects on people and the environment. Lava flows can destroy everything in their path, and ash and gas emissions can cause respiratory problems and other health issues. Volcanic ash can also affect the climate, as it reflects sunlight back into space, cooling the Earth's surface.\\n\\nDespite the destructive nature of volcanic eruptions, they can also be an enjoyable educational activity. Volcanoes are a natural wonder, and they can teach us a lot about the Earth's geology and the processes that shape our planet. Visiting a volcano can be a thrilling and educational experience, and it can help students to develop a greater appreciation for the natural world.\\n\\nIn conclusion, volcanoes are fascinating geological formations that are caused by the movement of tect\",\n",
       " 'Dear principal,\\n\\nMany teen students have been using cell phones during school. It is against school policy to do this and many teachers do not take much action in stopping this. But I believe that reconsidering this to allow students to use cell phones during free time and lunch is not a good idea. This is not a good idea because most cellular devices come with the use of internet and this can be abused by most teenage students.\\n\\nIf you consider policy number 1, then I believe students at lunch will use the internet on there phone to look up any answers to at test or any other forms of classroom work. Student could just skip a problem on a test and wait until lunch to look it up which defeats the purpose of studying and learning. Also cell phones could be abused the same way in other free times using text messaging. During free times a student could use text messaging to stay in touch with a friend who has already taken the test or work and cheat.\\n\\nAlso student could also use the internet by looking at graphic pictures or videos. During free times teachers do not know what the student could be doing on his or her cell phones. This could be a big problem to schools and teachers who allow the use of cell phones in class. Blocking these sites on school computers does not effect the same sites on a cell phone. So even though blocking the sites, this will not block the same sites visited on a cellular device by a student.\\n\\nStudents all over the country are abusing the use of cell phones in class. They use them to cheat during test and exams or use them to look up unapproved websites. And allowing them to have them out means less security on what they might be doing on them. So I do not agree on letting students use cell phones, and that there should be a higher security on the use of these devices because modern day cell phones are pretty much like hand held computers and you never know what a student could be using it for.',\n",
       " \"Distance learning options have become increasingly popular over the past decade, with growing numbers of students relying on online or video conferencing classes to attend school from home. While the ability to learn from one's own home offers numerous advantages - such as increased flexibility, lower costs, and more control over one's schedule - there are still a number of potential issues that must be taken into account, such as the potential for students to become easily distracted or procrastinate. \\n\\nIt is important to consider both the positive and negative impacts of distance learning. On one hand, there is evidence that distance learning can offer superior academic outcomes due to the focus that students have while working independently. In addition, many students who may feel overwhelmed by the more traditional environment find increased comfort and freedom in the home-based setting. On the other hand, there is also the potential for this type of learning to lead to poorer academic performance due to the lack of social interaction and peer motivation.\\n\\nIn conclusion, although there are both positives and negatives when it comes to providing distance learning options, the pros do appear to outweigh the cons. As such, it is essential that schools embrace this technology and provide the necessary resources to help students take advantage of these opportunities and maximize their potential.\",\n",
       " \"Have you ever found great difficulty in finding the right choice? Gaining the correct choice that can lead you through life can be difficult when you only have yourself to depend on. Ever since I first got the opportunity to face certain conflicts in my life, the right choice has always been unclear. Getting the chance to talk to multiple people in my life really guided and helped me with receiving multiple opinions as well. Multiple opinions meant multiple point of views. Most of the time, we tend to go to the people we trust in life to tell us the several possible outcomes with the different choices that can be made. Through all these opinions though, the right choice is usually gained by the one we most agree with. I believe that seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because of the personal experiences that take part, the inclusion of guidance, and the clear answer of what the wrong choice is through all the point of views.\\n\\nFirstly, receiving multiple opinions can help some with making the right choice because of the experiences they are based on. Usually, the wise beings we go to for help are adults that play a big role in our lives. This can include parents, relatives, and as well as family friends. Sometimes our own friends can share the same situation of conflict. Usually, the adults we look up to are the ones who are able to easily give us their opinion on the choices that are given in such circumstances. Sometimes the reason for that is because of their childhood and background. They may have been in the same situation around the same age, having to make their own different choices. In the end though, whether they made the right choice or not, they would've known what the correct option would've been. Knowing that, they'd be able to give you what they think is the decision that'd carry you past the conflict that you are facing. Being able to receive multiple experience-based opinions, you'd find yourself to have wise choices in your hands for you to choose from.\\n\\nSecondly, being able to grasp several opinions can help you to make a better choice because of the guidance that is involved. Once again, the people whom we trust are usually the ones we go to for their opinions, or rather, their guidance. They are all people who care for us as well, willing to help us with our conflict. Each opinion that they give you is on your behalf, knowing the outcome for you in your situation. Most of the time, they try to give their opinion knowing what's best for you. This leads us to realize that the choices they try to convince us to make are ones that won't let us down. All of their guidance should eventually lead us to the right path. The tendency to lead us to the correct choice is present through multiple opinions because of the care and knowledge that is mixed in as guidance.\\n\\nLastly, being able to seek multiple opinions can help to lead someone to the right path because of the wrong choice that can be eliminated through those several opinions. With the point of views that are given through the several people we tend to go to, there are always a few that we can argue against and eliminate. Though most may be wise, there are some that we can realize to not apply to the decision we are leaning towards. Even so, when our advisers try to convince us to make choices that are agreeable, the opposing option can always be crossed out as well. The multiple opinions given by our peers can sometimes give us the clear answer of what option we are not leaning towards.\\n\\nWhen we only have ourselves to depend on, the choices that we make tend to be doubtful. We may have lack of knowledge and experience, so how to deal with certain conflicts can be challenging. When we have the help of others' opinions, however, our path is cleared, and there are less to choose from. I have found myself to have plenty of people's opinions to choose from, and their guidance has caused me to keep walking on because of the right choices I have been able to make. The ability to receive several opinions can help someone to make a better choice because of the experiences they may be based off of, the guidance that is given, and the elimination of the obvious, wrong answers. Our every decision cannot be made based on our own doubtful thoughts when we have the help of others and their point of views in our lives. The wisdom of others can help us gain our own intelligence in\\xa0life's conflicts. Perhaps it can even help us with our future to gain our own wisdom and advisory for the satisfaction of others.\\xa0\",\n",

In this essay, I will outline the steps required to get into and graduate from college, set a schedule for studying and other activities, and reflect on the story of my mother working hard.\\n\\nThe first step in getting into and graduating from college is to research the requirements and expectations of the institutions you are interested in attending. This includes looking into the courses, grades, and test scores required for admission, as well as any additional requirements such as essays or letters of recommendation. It is important to carefully review the information and make sure you are meeting or exceeding the requirements.\\n\\nOnce you have a clear understanding of the requirements, the next step is to set a schedule for studying and other activities. This includes setting aside time for school, soccer practice, and any other extracurricular activities. It is important to prioritize your studies and make sure you are dedicating enough time to your academic pursuits. This may mean sacrificing some leisure time or adjusting your schedule to fit in additional study time.\\n\\nIn addition to setting a schedule, it is also important to participate in tutoring for Math and English if needed. This can help you improve your grades and ensure that you are meeting the requirements for admission to college. Tutoring can be done in person or online, and there are many resources available to help you find a tutor.\\n\\nIt is also important to avoid using cell phones or other distractions during school and study hours.

On the plus side, an added two hours could improve student attendance by providing a more structured schedule and giving students a purpose while outside of school. Increased responsibility could also be a result of extending the school day; with more time spent in the classroom, students would be better agitated to perform their best and follow the rules.\\n\\nOn the other hand, something that must be considered when making this decision is the trade-off between school and extracurricular activities. An extra two hours of school would take time away from other personal pursuits and could limit the amount of time that students have for things such as sports, music, and community service. \\n\\nUltimately, while extending the school day could bring about various positive changes, a careful evaluation of the potential benefits and risks should be conducted in order to determine if the extended day would be a viable option for Generic_School.

I know students that can\\'t stop texting, during class, even though phones are supposed to stay in lockers. I feel like we should be able to have phones, but we could have designated times to use them. Lunch, is not a \"class\", it is the only 40 minute break from learning students have. In the hallways is another good example, students have 4 minutes to get to class, they can spend those four minutes however they want, except for texting. That should be changed. Students may need to text mom and tell her that volleyball practice is cancelled. Or that they need gym clothes. It is much easier than running down to the office to call her. I understand that phones can be a disruption from learning.\\n\\nBut, students are more likely to secretly text in class if cell phones aren\\'t allowed. And a lot of students go to their locker, or the bathroom during class just to text. So you have to think, would you rather have kids more worried about texting in class, and not learning; or, paying full attention and knowing that they can text later? A student won\\'t feel a necessity to answer a text right away, and get off task in class, if they know they will be able to at lunch, or in the hallway. I feel that changing the cell phone rule would benefit everyone, from the students, to teachers. It can even benefit you. Teachers will be more focused on class and not worrying about taking phone\\'s away from students. And like I mentioned before, the students won\\'t be so worried about getting caught, and they will focus on their work.\\n\\nA day with cell phone\\'s allowed, would be a positive influence, just give it a try. Coming from a student, trust me, it will be much, much better. In conclusion I think that changing the schools cell phone policy would be a great idea.\\n\\nThanks.',\n",
       " \"As an 8th grader, I believe that having self-sufficiency in one's life is incredibly important. Self-sufficiency means being able to take care of oneself and one's needs without relying on external help. While seeking guidance from experts can be beneficial, there are advantages and disadvantages to both making one's own decisions and relying on external help.\\n\\nOne of the biggest advantages of making one's own decisions is the sense of personal growth and development that comes with it. When we take care of ourselves and make our own choices, we learn to trust ourselves and our abilities. This can lead to increased confidence and self-esteem, which are essential for success in life. Additionally, when we rely on ourselves, we are less likely to be dependent on others, which can help us become more independent and self-sufficient.\\n\\nOn the other hand, relying on external help can also have its advantages. For example, experts can provide valuable guidance and support that can help us make better decisions and avoid mistakes. They can also offer a fresh perspective and new ideas that we may not have thought of on our own. Furthermore, when we seek guidance from experts, we can save time and energy that we would have spent trying to figure things out on our own.\\n\\nHowever, there are also disadvantages to relying on external help. For one, we may miss out on the opportunity to learn and grow through the process of making our own decisions. When we rely on others, we may not develop the skills and knowledge that come with making our own choices. Additionally, relying on others can lead to a loss of control and agency, as we may not have as much say in the decisions that affect our lives.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while both making one's own decisions and seeking guidance from experts have their advantages and disadvantages, I believe that having self-sufficiency in one's life is crucial for personal growth and development. By learning to take care of ourselves and make our own choices, we can develop the skills and confidence we need to succeed in life. However, seeking guidance from experts can also be beneficial, as they can provide valuable support and new perspectives.

       " 'Are you sure your making the right choice by doing it on your own? When people ask for advice, they sometimes like to talk to more than one person about making the right choice. In my pinion, asking people for advice is all about who you ask. People could ask others who think they know the answers but they dont really have the right information to guide them in the right direction, they could ask others who will give that person advice, but it would not be the wisest or smartest, and they could ask others who will help give them the right advice to make a good decision.\\n\\nWhen asking for advice about something big, or something as small as an ant, it can get difficult trying to find the right people to ask. Most people ask for advice when the are not sure of something. A lot of individuals receive the wrong advice because they get it from the wrong people who dont know anything about the subject. For example, on my new softball team, some of the girls on my team gave me some advice about standing in the batters box when I am up to bat. They told me to stand a certain way so that I can hit the ball harder. when I did it, nothing changed. my swing was the same and the ball went no farther than it did before. then when those girls came up to bat, they were not even dong it and when they hit, the ball went nowhere. that was a lesson for me that I can seek multiple opinions and guides to help myself be a better person and make good choices.\\n\\nWhile seeking advice from others, it is important that we make our decisions wisely and carefully. Some people may grant us the wrong information or advice to try and make us do something really wrong unwise. for instance, \" They can be your friends one minute, and your enemies the next.\". To me this quote means that someone can be there for us, help us out, and give you really good advice, and then just leave that person, betray them or just do them dirty. I think that this quote relates to \" Receiving advice from multiple people \" because people can sometimes give us advice or tell us to do something just to see us fail or to get others in trouble. All people need to make sure that they choose the right people to trust to get advice from.\\n\\nThe last type of person that people could get advice from are people that may have had experience with it or know more about it then we do. For example, when I need advice on school or softball, I ask my mother, my father and some other relatives that I know know more about the subject. Another example is if a person seeks advice to make a bad choice, that person can ask multiple people about it and the person giving advice can guide the other person into making a much wiser choice. Getting the right advice from the right people will help many others make wiser decisions and living a better life.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I think that seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. At the end of the day though,it is all about our decision and it is also all about our choice and what we want to do. Many people ask for advice when they are not sure of something or not sure of what to do. Are you going to be the person who thinks they know the answers but they dont really have the right information to guide them in the right direction, the person who will give that person advice, but it would not be the wisest or smartest, or the person who will help give them the right advice to make a good decision and leave them on the right path?   \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0',\n",

We could also be making the world safer by having an alert system for if the human driver gets distracted while driving. They also mentioned having a touch sensor on the wheel to make sure the human driver is paying attention. Driverless cars could be a step into the future for everyone.\\n\\nDriverless cars can have their bad sides, but it's nothing that can't be fixed overtime. Look how far we've gotten already. I think driverless cars are a great idea and we should continue the good work.\",\n",
